  		  <h3>What Information Do We Collect?</h3>
            <p>The Graphic applications on iOS and macOS do not collect any personal information, and do not track or transmit any analytics data. The applications will only connect to the network when iCloud syncing is enabled, or when accessing third-party online storage systems, such as Dropbox. Files are transmitted directly to each service, and we never have access to your files or other data. No personal data is ever transmitted to us.</p>

            <p>When contacting our support team via email, our issue tracking system will keep a record of the issue details and relevant contact information. This helps us improve our applications based on the feedback provided, and also allows us to follow-up on inquiries and provide better customer support. Your contact information is used solely for support-related purposes and is never shared with any third-parties.</p>

  		  <h3>iCloud Syncing</h3>
            <p>If you have iCloud Drive enabled, your documents will be uploaded to Apple's iCloud servers, so they can automatically sync across to your other devices. We never have access to your files or other data. You can switch off iCloud syncing in the application settings.</p>
