In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a glowing switch button in Graphic for iPad. 

For starters you will learn how to create a new document and how to setup a simple grid. Using basic tools like the Rectangle and the Rounded Rectangle Tool, you will learn how to create the background  and the main buttons shapes. Taking full advantage of the Effects pane, you will learn how to add vibrant colors, subtle shading and some glow for your button pieces. 

Finally, you'll learn how to add some simple pieces of text and how to easily stylize them. 





##Step 1

From the **Documents Browser**, tap the plus button at the top-right corner of the **Titlebar** and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. In the **Canvas** pane set the **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base units, and verify that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled.

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** pane in the **Settings** popover. Ensure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or **Snap to Grid**. Finally, simply open the **Grid Spacing** pane, enter **10 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 px** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and you will notice that by default the fill color is set to white and the stroke color is set to black. Simply tap on the stroke color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**, which will simply make the stroke invisible. 

Move to the fill color and tap it. Select **Gradient Fill** and **Radial**, set the angle to **0 degrees** and then move to the gradient sliders. Select the left one and set its color to **R=2 G=53 B=83** and then select the right one and se its color to **R=0 G=10 B=18**. Pick the **Rectangle  Tool**, focus on your canvas and create a **600 px** square, the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.

##Step 5

Make sure that your rounded rectangle stays selected, focus on the right side of your Titlebar and tap the leftmost icon. Go to the **Effects** pane and simply check the  box that stands for the existing **Drop Shadow** to activate it. 

Enter **1** in the **Y** box and **0** in the other two boxes and then tap the color well that stands for this effect. Set the color to white (**R=255 G=255 B=255**) and drag the **Alpha** slider to **30%**. Return to the **Effects** pane,  simply tap the cogwheel icon that stands for your **Drop  Shadow** effect and go to **Blend Mode**.

Select the left one and set its color to **R=1 G=68 B=105** and then select the right one and set its color to **R=41 G=108 B=146**. Simply tap on the gradient bar and you will get a new gradient slider. Select it, set the color to **R=31 G=98 B=136** and drag it to the left until the **Location** tooltip shows **20%**.
