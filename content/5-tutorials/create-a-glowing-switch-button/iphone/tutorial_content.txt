In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a glowing switch button in Graphic for iPhone. 

For starters you will learn how to create a new document and how to setup a simple grid. Using basic tools like the Rectangle and the Rounded Rectangle Tool, you will learn how to create the background  and the main buttons shapes. Taking full advantage of the Effects pane, you will learn how to add vibrant colors, subtle shading and some glow for your button pieces. 

Finally, you'll learn how to add some simple pieces of text and how to easily stylize them. 





##Step 1

Start by tapping the   plus button from the top-left corner of your screen to create a new document. Tap the **Create Document** button and then choose the **Grid** document style.

Re-open the **Properties** panel and this time tap the **Grid** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open the **Grid Settings** pane, enter **10 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and you will notice that by default the fill color is set to white and the stroke color is set to black. Simply tap on the stroke color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**, which will simply make the stroke invisible. 

Move to the fill color and tap it. Tap the **Gradient**  button and then **Radial** icon, set the angle to **0 degrees** and then move to the gradient sliders. Select the left one and set its color to **R=3 G=54 B=84** and then select the right one and set its color to **R=0 G=11 B=18**. Pick the **Rectangle  Tool**, focus on your canvas and create a **600 px** square, the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.
