In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a glowing switch button in Graphic for Mac. 

For starters you will learn how to create a new document and how to setup a simple grid. Using basic tools like the Rectangle and the Rounded Rectangle Tool, you will learn how to create the background  and the main buttons shapes. Taking full advantage of the Effects pane, you will learn how to add vibrant colors, subtle shading and some glow for your button pieces. 

Finally, you'll learn how to add some simple pieces of text and how to easily stylize them. 





##Step 1

For this tutorial we'll create a new **600 x 600 pixel** document. Choose **File &gt; New (Command + N)** to bring up the **New Document** panel. Select the **Grid** document style, set the document units to **pixels**, and set the document dimensions to **600** pixels wide by **600** pixels high.

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. If the **Properties** panel is not currently visible, you can click on the orange ruler icon above the **Layers** panel to show and hide the panel. Change the grid **X Spacing** and **Y Spacing** to **10 px**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0px**, and enable **Snap to Grid (Command + Shift + ')**.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and you will notice that by default the fill color is set to white and the stroke color is set to black. Simply click on the stroke color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**, which will simply make the stroke invisible.
 
Pick the **Rectangle  Tool (M)**, focus on your canvas and create a **600px** square. Holding the **Shift** button will make it a lot easier for you to create a perfect square, also the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work. 

Make sure that your shape stays selected and focus on the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel. If the **Appearance** panel is not currently visible, you can click on the blue icon above the **Layers** panel to show and hide the panel. Focus on the **Fill** and select **Radial Gradient** from the **Type** drop-down menu. Set the angle to **0 degrees** then move to the gradient sliders. Select the left one and set its color at **R=2 G=53 B=83** then select the right one and se its color at **R=0 G=10 B=18**.

Reselect the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)**, focus on the Tool Options bar and make sure that the **Corner Radius** is still set to **25pt**. Create a **100 x 46 px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the following image. Once again, the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will come in handy. 

Make sure that your new shape stays selected and focus on the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel. Focus on the **Fill** and select **Linear Gradient** from the **Type** drop-down menu. Set the angle to **90 degrees** and then move to the gradient sliders. Select the left one and set its color to **R=1 G=68 B=105** and then select the right one and se its color to **R=41 G=108 B=146**. Simply click on the gradient bar and you will get a new gradient slider. Select it, set the color to **R=31 G=98 B=136** and drag it to the left until the **Location** tooltip shows **20%**. 

Add another three  sliders for this gradient then use the color and the location attributes shown in the following image. In the end things should look like in the following image. This new rounded rectangle will be the button.
