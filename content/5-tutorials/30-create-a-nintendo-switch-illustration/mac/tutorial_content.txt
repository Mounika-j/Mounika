In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a detailed Nintendo Switch illustration in Graphic for Mac. 

For starters, you will learn how to set-up a simple grid, how to center objects and how to numerically position shapes. Using basic shapes along with some boolean commands, you will learn how to create the more complex objects. Taking full advantage of the Effects pane and its features, you will learn how to add subtle shading and highlights.
 
Using the Layers panel, you will learn how to group, organize and name the components of your illustration. Finally, you will learn how to easily multiply objects and how to add a pretty simple text label. 

If you're new to Graphic and fear that you might not be able to easily follow the tutorial, a quick read of the [Graphic User Guide](http://graphic.com/docs/welcome) might be what you need. It's not a must, but it will help you get familiarised with Graphic's interface, tools and features. Whether you read it or not following the tutorial should be fairly easy. Let's get started. 



##Step 1

For this tutorial we'll create a **780 x 450 px** document. Go to **File &gt; New (Command - N)** to bring up the **New Document** pop-up window. Select the **Grid** document style and set the document units to **pixels**. Set the document dimensions to **780** pixels wide by **450** pixels high and then click **Choose** to create your document. 

Next, we'll adjust the document grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. You can easily open or close the **Properties** panel using that ruler icon. Change the **X** &amp; **Y Spacing** to **5**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0** and don't forget to enable **Snap to Grid** – all these features will make your work easier.

Don't forget that you can quickly enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature using the  **Command +  '** and the  **Command + Shift + '** keyboard shortcuts. Do your best to get used with keyboard shortcuts, using them will save you a lot of time.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and click the **Stroke** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** to simply make your **Stroke** invisible. Click the **Fill** color well and replace the existing color with **R=255 G=180 B=0**. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)**, focus on the **Tool Options bar** and drag that **Corner Radius** slider to **2 pt**. Move to your canvas and create a **410 x 240 px** shape.

##Step 3

Make sure that your rounded rectangle is still selected and open the **Alignment** pane from the **Properties** panel. Click the **Horizontal Centers** and **Vertical Centers** commands to move your selection in the center of the canvas.

##Step 4

For the following steps you will need a grid every **1 px**. This simply means that you need to return to the **Grid**  pane from the **Properties** panel and enter **1 px** in both  **Spacing** boxes.  

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)** and set the **Corner Radius** to **5 pt**. Create a **15 px** rounded square and place it exactly as shown in the first image. Hold the **Shift** key while dragging to easily create a perfect rounded square. You can position this shape manually, using the grid as a references or you can do it numerically using the **Geometry** pane from the **Properties** panel. Make sure that your rounded square is selected, focus on the **Position** settings, and then set the **X** to **177 px** and the **Y** to **100 px**. 

Switch to the **Rectangle Tool (M)** and create two, **4 px** squares. Place these new shapes as shown in the second image. 

(image: NintendoSwitch4.jpg)



##Step 5

Pick the **Move Tool (V)**, hold down the **Shift** key and select your rounded square along with the two tiny squares. Duplicate these shapes (**Command + D**), flip the copies horizontally (**Modify &gt; Rotate and Transform &gt; Flip Horizontal**) and then place them as shown in the second image.

##Step 6

Using the **Move Tool (V)**, select all the shapes made so far. Open the **Path Tools** pane from the **Properties** panel and click the **Subtract** command.

##Step 7

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)** and set the **Corner Radius** to **2 pt**. Create two, **10 px** rounded squares and place them as shown in the first image. 

Using the same tool, create another two, **10 px** rounded squares and place them as shown in the second image.

##Step 9

Make sure that your shape stays selected and open the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel – click the leftmost inspector panel icon to open or close the **Appearance** panel whenever you want.

Click the existing **Fill** and replace the **Color** with a **Linear Gradient**. Set the **Angle** to **90 °** and then move to the gradient color stops. Click the left one and set its color to **R=33 G=36 B=37**, and then click the right one and set its color to **R=43 G=46 B=47**. Simply click on the gradient bar to add a new color stop. Set its location to **99%** and chnage the color to **R=101 G=102 B=102**. Add another three color stops and use the settings shown in the following image.

##Step 10

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)** and set the **Corner Radius** to **5 pt**. Create a **390 x 220 px** shape and fill it with **R=2 G=2 B=2**. Make sure that this new shape stays selected and move it to the center of the canvas using the same **Horizontal Centers** and **Vertical Centers** commands from the **Alignment** pane. 

(image: NintendoSwitch10.jpg)



##Step 11

##Step 13

Go to the **Layers** panel, double click the name of the existing layer and change it to _&quot;Screen&quot;_. Use the add button **(+)** from the bottom of the panel to add a second layer. Rename it _&quot;Sides&quot;_ and make sure that it remains selected, as the new shapes you are about to create will go here.

For the following steps you will need a grid every **5 px**. Return to the **Grid**  pane from the **Properties** panel and enter **5 px** in both  **Spacing** boxes. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)** and set the **Corner Radius** to **50 pt**. Create a **120 x 240 px** shape and place it as shown in the first image (**X: 555px Y: 105 px**).

(image: NintendoSwitch15.jpg)



##Step 16

Select the three shapes highlighted in the first step and click the **Union** command from the **Path Tools** pane. Fill the resulting shape with **R=249 G=85 B=71** and then add a copy in the same place (**Command + C &gt; Shift + Command   + V**).

(image: NintendoSwitch16.jpg)



##Step 17

Pick the **Rectangle Tool (M)**, create a **70 x 40 px** shape and place it as shown in the first image. Select this new rectangle along with the copy of that red shape and click the **Intersect** command from the **Path Tools** pane. 

Make sure that the resulting shape stays selected, remove the **Fill** color, and then focus on the **Stroke** pane from the **Appearance** panel. Set the **Stroke** color to **R=43 G=46 B=47**, change the **Line Weight** to **6 pt** and don't forget to check the **Round Join** button.
