In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a detailed Nintendo Switch illustration in Graphic for iPad. 

For starters, you will learn how to set up a simple grid, how to center objects and how to numerically position shapes. Using basic shapes along with some boolean commands, you will learn how to create the more complex objects. Taking full advantage of the Effects pane and its features, you will learn how to add subtle shading and highlights. 

Using the Layers panel, you will learn how to group, organize and name the components of your illustration. Finally, you will learn how to easily multiply objects and how to add a pretty simple text label. 



##Step 1

From the **Documents Browser**, tap the plus button at the top-left corner of the **Titlebar** and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. In the **Canvas** pane set the **Width** to **780 px** and the **Height** to **450 px**, select **Pixels** for the base units, and make sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled. When this setting is enabled, stroked objects are offset slightly to ensure that the stroke is drawn aligned to the pixel grid which guarantees a crisp look.

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Tap again that **Settings** icon and switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** pane. 

Be sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid** feature.  Open the **Grid Settings** pane, enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and tap the **Line** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** to simply make your **Line** invisible.
 
Tap the **Fill** color well and replace the existing color with **R=255 G=180 B=0**.

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool** and set the **Radius** to **2** in the **Tool pane**. Create a **410 x 240 px** shape.

##Step 4

For the following steps you will need a grid every **1 px**. This simply means that you need to open the **Grid &amp; Rulers**  pane, open the **Grid Settings** pane and enter **1 px** in both  **Spacing** boxes.  

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool** and set the  **Radius** to **5**. Create a **15 px** rounded square and place it exactly as shown in the first image. Tap and hold with a second finger while dragging to easily create a perfect rounded square. You can position this shape manually, using the grid as a references or you can do it numerically using the **Geometry** pane. Make sure that your rounded square is selected and tap that ruler icon from the right side of your **Titlebar** to open the **Geometry** pane. Focus on the **Position** settings, and then set the **X** to **177 px** and the **Y** to **100 px**. 

Switch to the **Rectangle Tool**  and create two, **4 px** squares. Place these new shapes as shown in the second image.

Make sure that these new shapes remain selected, open the **Geometry** pane and tap the  **Flip Horizontal** button to flip your selected shapes horizontally. Once you're done, place them as shown in the second image.

##Step 9

Make sure that your shape stays selected and focus on the right side of your **Titlebar**. Tap the leftmost icon and go to the **Effects** pane. 

Tap the color well of the existing **Fill** and replace the **Color** with a **Linear Gradient**. Set the **Angle** to **-90 °** and then move to the gradient color stops. Tap the left one and set its color to **R=33 G=36 B=37**, and then tap the right one and set its color to **R=43 G=46 B=47**. Simply tap on the gradient bar to add a new color stop.
