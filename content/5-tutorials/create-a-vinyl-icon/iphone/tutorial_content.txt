In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a vinyl icon in Graphic for iPhone. 

For starters you will learn how to create a new document and how to setup a simple grid. Taking full advantage of the Snap to Grid feature, you will learn how to create the main shapes and how to quickly center them on your canvas. Moving on, you'll learn basic vector shape building techniques and some simple tips on how to add shading and highlights using the Effects pane. 

Finally, you'll learn how to add and adjust a simple piece of text.





##Step 1

Start by tapping the   plus button from the top-left corner of your screen to create a new document. Tap the **Create Document** button and then choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar**, tap that ruler icon to open the **Properties** panel and then tap the **Canvas** pane. Set both **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and be sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled.

Re-open the **Properties** panel and this time tap the **Grid** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open the **Grid Settings** pane and enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar**, tap the fill color well and set its color to **R=43 G=164 B=13** and then tap the line color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**, which will simply make your line invisible.
 
Pick the **Ellipse Tool**, focus on your canvas and create a **150 px** circle. The grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.

Make sure that your green shape stays selected and focus on the right side of your Titlebar. Open the **Align** pane from the **Properties** panel and then simply tap the  **Horizontal** and  **Vertical** buttons to easily bring your circle in the center of the canvas.

##Step 3

Focus on the right side of your Titlebar and tap the rightmost icon to open the **Layers** panel. Simply tap the existing layers to open that edit menu and tap the **Duplicate** command. Make sure that the newly added layer is selected and then close the **Layers** panel.

Select your green circle, focus on the right side of your Titlebar and tap the leftmost icon to open the **Appearance** panel. Go to the **Effects** pane, tap the color well that stands for the existing **Fill** and simply drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**. 

Next, select the existing **Stroke** and make sure that the **Width** slider is set to **1 pt**. Tap the **Inside** Alignment button and then simply tap the color well that stands for your **Stroke**. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **10%** and make sure that the color is set to black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**). Return to the **Effects** pane and tap the cogwheel icon that stands for your **Stroke**. Tap the **Blend Mode** command and select  **Soft Light** from that list. In the end things should look like in the following image.

##Step 4

Make sure that your  stroked circle is still selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** pane and simply check the  box that stands for the existing **Drop Shadow**  to activate it. Enter **1** in the **Y** box and **0** in the other two boxes, change the **Blend Mode** to **Soft Light** and then tap the color well that stands for this effect. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **5%** and replace the existing color with a simple white (**R=255 G=255 B=255**).

##Step 5

Select your stroked circle, focus on the right side of the Titlebar and tap the ruler icon to open the **Geometry** panel. Focus on the **Size** pane and decrease the existing **Width** and **Height** attributes by **4 px**. Once you're done, move to the **Align** pane and tap those  **Horizontal** and  **Vertical** buttons to re-center your circle.

##Step 6

Reselect your stroked circle, tap and hold to open that edit menu and then use the **Copy** and **Paste** commands to duplicate your selected shape. Select this copy, open the **Geometry** pane and  decrease the existing **Width** and **Height** attributes by **4 px**. Once you're done, center this shape using the same   **Horizontal** and  **Vertical** buttons from the **Align** pane. In the end you should have a **142 px** circle looking like the one in the second image.

##Step 7

Now, you need to keep repeating the technique mentioned in the previous until you get to a **58 px** circle. The process is pretty simple: always select the tiniest circle, make a copy and select it, decrease the existing **Width** and **Height** attributes by **4 px** and don't forget to also center it. 

Once you're done, select all your stroked circles, open the **Properties** panel and tap that **Group** button.

##Step 8

Open the **Layers** panel, select the bottom layer and then close the **Layers** panel. 

Using the **Ellipse Tool**, create a **30 px** circle and place it as shown in the following image. The color is not very important, but remember that you can easily center this shape using those commands from the **Align** pane. 
Select your green and yellow circles, focus on the **Combine** pane from the **Properties** panel and tap the **Subtract** button.

Simply tap on the gradient bar and you will get a new gradient slider. Select it, set the color to **R=45 G=40 B=35** and then drag it to the left until the **Location** tooltip shows **10%**. Add another eight gradient sliders and then follow the color and **Location** attributes shown in the following image.
