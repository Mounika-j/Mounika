In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a vinyl icon in Graphic for iPad. 

For starters you will learn how to create a new document and how to setup a simple grid. Taking full advantage of the Snap to Grid feature, you will learn how to create the main shapes and how to quickly center them on your canvas. Moving on, you'll learn basic vector shape building techniques and some simple tips on how to add shading and highlights using the Effects pane. 

Finally, you'll learn how to add and adjust a simple piece of text.





##Step 1

From the **Documents Browser**, tap the plus button at the top-left corner of the **Titlebar** and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. In the **Canvas** pane set the **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base units, and verify that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled.

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** pane in the **Settings** popover. Ensure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or **Snap to Grid**. Finally, simply tap the **Grid Spacing** pane, enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar**, tap the fill color well and set its color to **R=43 G=164 B=13** and then tap the line color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**, which will simply make your line invisible. 

Pick the **Ellipse Tool**, focus on your canvas and create a **150 px** circle. The grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work. Make sure that your green shape stays selected, focus on the right side of your Titlebar and tap that rectangular icon. Focus on the **Arrange** pane and simply tap the **Align Horizontal** and **Align Vertical** buttons to easily bring your circle in the center of the canvas.

##Step 3

Select your green circle, focus on the left side of your Titlebar and tap that paperclip icon to open the popover menu. First, tap the **Copy** command and then tap the **Paste in Place** command which will create a copy of your selected shape in the same location. 

Select the newly made copy, focus on the right side of your Titlebar and tap the leftmost icon. Move to the **Effects** pane, tap the color well that stands for the existing **Fill** and simply drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**. Next, select the existing **Stroke** and make sure that the **Width** slider is set to **1pt**. Tap the **Inside** Alignment button and then simply tap the color well that stands for your **Stroke**. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **10%** and make sure that the color is set to black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**). Return to the **Effects** pane and tap the cogwheel icon that stands for your **Stroke**. Tap the **Blend Mode** command, select the **Soft Light** blend mode and then tap that **Done** button. In the end things should look like in the following image.

##Step 4

Focus on the right side of your Titlebar and tap the rightmost icon to open the **Layers** pane. Double tap  the name of your top shape and simply rename it &quot;_grid_&quot;. 

Select this shape, focus on the **Effects** pane and simply check the little box that stands for the existing **Drop Shadow**  to activate it. Enter **1** in the **Y** box and **0** in the other two boxes, change the **Blend Mode** to **Soft Light** and then tap the color well that stands for this effect. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **5%** and replace the existing color with a simple white (**R=255 G=255 B=255**).

##Step 5

Select your &quot;_grid_&quot; shape, focus on the right side of your Titlebar and tap the ruler icon to open the **Geometry** panel. Focus on the **Size** pane and use those minus buttons to decrease the existing **Width** and **Height** attributes by **4 px**. Once you're done, move to the **Arrange** pane and tap those **Align Horizontal** and **Align Vertical** buttons to center your circle.

##Step 6

Reselect your &quot;_grid_&quot; shape and make a copy in front using the same **Copy** and **Paste in Place** commands from that paperclip popover menu. Select this copy, return to the **Geometry** panel and  decrease the existing **Width** and **Height** attributes by **4 px**. Once you're done, move to the **Arrange** pane and tap the **Align Horizontal** and **Align Vertical** buttons. In the end you should have a **142 px** shape that will look like in the second image.

##Step 7

Now, you need to keep repeating the technique mentioned in the previous until you get to a **58 px** circle. The process is pretty simple: always select the tiniest circle, make a copy in front, select it and decrease the existing **Width** and **Height** attributes by **4 px**. Don't forget to also center it. 

Once you're done, move to the **Layers** panel. First, focus on the bottom side and activate the button highlighted in the following image. This will allow you to select more than one shape from the **Layers** panel. Now, select all your &quot;_grid_&quot; shapes, move to the **Arrange** pane (or tap the cogwheel icon from the bottom, left corner of the **Layers** pane) and simply tap the **Group** button.

##Step 8

Using the **Ellipse Tool**, create a **30 px** circle and place it as shown in the following image. The color is not very important, but remember that you can easily center this shape using those commands from the **Arrange** pane. 

Pick the **Path Selection Tool**, focus on the newly opened tool pane and activate the **Add to Selection** mode. Select the shape made in this step along with your green circle, focus on the **Combine** pane an tap the **Subtract** button. Make sure that the resulting shape is selected, move to the **Arrange** pane and simply drag that **Order** slider to the left. This will simply send your selected shape in the back.

##Step 9

Make sure that your green shape stays selected, focus on the **Effects** pane and tap the color well that stands for the existing **Fill**. 

Select **Gradient Fill** and **Angle** and then move to the gradient sliders. Select the left slider and replace the existing color with **R=35 G=30 B=25** and then select the right slider and add the same color. Simply tap on the gradient bar and you will get a new gradient slider. Select it, set the color to **R=45 G=40 B=35** and then drag it to the left until the **Location** tooltip shows **10%**. Add another eight gradient sliders and then follow the color and **Location** attributes shown in the following image.
