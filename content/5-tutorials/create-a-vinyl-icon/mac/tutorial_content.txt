In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a vinyl icon in Graphic for Mac. 

For starters you will learn how to create a new document and how to setup a simple grid. Taking full advantage of the Snap to Grid feature, you will learn how to create the main shapes and how to quickly center them on your canvas. Moving on, you'll learn basic vector shape building techniques and some simple tips on how to add shading and highlights using the Effects pane. 

Finally, you'll learn how to add and adjust a simple piece of text.





##Step 1

Go to **File &gt; New (Command + N)** to bring up the **New Document** pane. Select the **Grid** document style, set the document units to **pixels**, and set the document dimensions to **600** pixels wide by **600**pixels high.
Next, we'll set up the document grid. 

Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. If the **Properties** panel is not currently visible, you can click on the orange ruler icon above the **Layers** pane to show and hide the panel. Change the grid **X Spacing** and **Y Spacing** to **5 px**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0 px** and enable **Snap to Grid (Command + Shift + ')**.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar**, click on the fill color well and set the  color to **R=43 G=164 B=13**. Next, click on the stroke color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**, which will simply make the stroke invisible.
 
Pick the **Ellipse Tool (O)**, focus on your canvas and create a **150 px** circle. Holding the **Shift** button will make it a lot easier for you to create a perfect circle, the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will also ease your work. Make sure that your green shape stays selected, focus on the **Alignment** pane from the **Properties** panel and simply click the **Horizontal Centers** and **Vertical Centers** buttons to easily bring your circle in the center of the canvas.

##Step 3

Now, select your green circle and simply make a copy in front (**Command + C &gt; Command + Shift + V**). Make sure that this copy stays selected and focus on the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** pane. If the **Appearance** pane is not currently visible, you can click on the blue icon above the **Layers** pane to show and hide the panel. 

 First, click the color well that stands for the existing **Fill** and simply drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**. Next, select the existing **Stroke** and make sure that the **Width** slider is set to **1 pt**. Select **Inside** from the **Position** drop-down menu and **Soft Light** from the **Blend Mode** drop-down menu and then  click the color well that stands for your **Stroke**. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **10%** and make sure that the color is set to black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**). 
 
For the following steps you will need a grid every **1 px** . This simply means that you need to return to the **Grid**  pane from the **Properties** pane and enter **1 px** in both  **Spacing** boxes.

##Step 4

Focus on the **Layers** pane and open the existing layer. Double click on the name of your top shape and simply rename it &quot;_grid_&quot;. 

Select this shape, focus on the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel and  check the  box that stands for the existing **Drop Shadow**  to activate it. Enter **1** in the **Y** box and **0** in the other two boxes, select **Soft Light** from the **Blend Mode** drop-down menu and then click the color well that stands for this effect. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **5%** and replace the existing color with a simple white (**R=255 G=255 B=255**).

##Step 5

Reselect your &quot;_grid_&quot; shape and make sure that the **Move Tool (V)** is active. Hold the **Alt** and **Shift** buttons from your keyboard, drag one of those corners to the inside and simply contract **4 px** from your shape. In the end you should have a **146 px** circle that looks like in the second image.

##Step 6

Make sure that your &quot;_grid_&quot; shape is selected and make a new copy in front (**Command + C &gt; Command + Shift + V**). Select this copy, contract it by **4 px** and you should end up with a **142 px** circle as shown in the second image.

##Step 7

Now, you need to keep repeating the technique mentioned in the previous step until you get to a **58 px** circle. The process is pretty simple: always select the newest circle, make a copy in front (**Command + C &gt; Command + Shift + V**), select the copy and contract it by **4 px**.

Once you're done, move to the **Layers** panel, select all your &quot;_grid_&quot; circles and simply hit the **Command + G** keyboard shortcut to **Group** them.
 
For the following steps you will need a grid every **5 px**, so return to the **Grid**  pane from the **Properties** panel and enter **5 px** in both  **Spacing** boxes.

##Step 8

Using the **Ellipse Tool (O)**, create a **30 px** circle and place it as shown in the following image. The color is not very important, but remember that you can easily center this shape using those commands from the **Alignment** pane. 

Now, select this new shape along with the green circle, focus on the **Path Tools** pane from the **Properties** panel an click the **Subtract** button. Make sure that the resulting shape is selected and simply hit **Shift + Command + [** to send it to back.

##Step 9

Select the left slider, set the color to **R=35 G=30 B=25** and then select the right slider and add the same color. Simply click on the gradient bar and you will get a new gradient slider. Select it, set the color to **R=45 G=40 B=35** and then drag it to the left until the **Location** tooltip shows **10%**. Add another eight gradient sliders and then follow the color and **Location** attributes shown in the following image.
