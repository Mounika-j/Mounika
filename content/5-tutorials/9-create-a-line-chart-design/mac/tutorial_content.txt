In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a neat line chart design in  Graphic for Mac. 

For starters you will learn how to set up a simple grid and how to create the main shape using the Rounded Rectangle Tool. Next, you''ll learn how to ease your work with a simple script and the use of that Align stroke to pixel grid feature. Taking full advantage of the Effects pane, you will learn how how to create the colored lines. 

Finally, you'll learn how to add a bunch of text and how to stylize it. 





##Step 1

Go to **File &gt; New (Command + N)** to bring up the **New Document** window. Select the **Grid** document style, set the document units to **pixels**, and set the document dimensions to **600** pixels wide by **600** pixels high.

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. If the **Properties** panel is not currently visible, you can easily open it using the ruler icon that lies above the **Layers** panel. Change the grid **X Spacing** and **Y Spacing** to **5**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0**, and enable **Snap to Grid (Command + Shift + ')**.

Keep in mind that you can quickly enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature using the  **Command +  '** and  **Command + Shift + '** keyboard shortcuts.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the stroke color is set to black.
 
Click  the stroke color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** to make your stroke invisible and then click  the fill color well and set the  color to **R=54 G=54 B=65**. Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift-M)**, focus on your **Tool Options** bar and drag the **Corner Radius** slider to **5 pt**. Move to your canvas  and create a **310 x 340 px** shape.

##Step 3

For this step you will need to download the [Create Rectangular Grid plugin](https://graphic.com/plugins/). Go to **File &gt; Plugin &gt; Manage Plug-ins**. Copy your **Create Rectangular Grid** plugin inside the newly opened folder then close it. 

Get back to your Graphic file and this time go to **File &gt; Plugin &gt; Create Rectangular Grid**. Enter **10** in the **Horizontal Lines** and **Vertical Lines** boxes, set the **Width** and **Height** to **220 px** and then click that **OK** button. 

Make sure that this new group of paths stays selected, place it exactly as shown in the following image and then focus on the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel. If the **Appearance** panel is not currently visible, you can easily open it using the leftmost icon that lies above the **Layers** panel. Click the color well that stands for the existing **Fill** and simply drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**.

##Step 4

Make sure that the group made in the previous step is still selected and simply hit **Shift + Command + G** to **Ungroup** it. 

Using the **Move Tool (V)**, select the four paths that make up the outer edges of your grid and simply remove them using the **Delete** button from your keyboard. Select the remaining paths that make up your grid and focus on the **Stroke** pane. Make sure that the **Line Weight** is set to **1 pt** and check the **Round Cap** button.

##Step 5

For this step you need to enable the pixel preview which allows you to see how things would look if you decide to save your work as an image. Go to **View &gt; Show Pixels** and notice how your black paths get a bit pixelated. This simply happens because your paths are not perfectly aligned to the pixel grid, but it can be fixed pretty easy. Just go to **Graphic &gt; Preferences** and check that **Align strokes to pixel grid** box. Once you're done, don't forget to return to **View &gt; Show Pixels** and disable this feature.

Make sure that the resulting shape stays selected, focus on the **Effects** pane and replace the existing **Fill** color with **R=44 G=44 B=54**.

##Step 7

Make sure that the shape made in the previous step is still selected, focus on the **Effects** pane and check the  box that stands for the existing **Drop Shadow** effect to enable it.
