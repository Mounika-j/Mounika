In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a neat line chart design in  Graphic for iPhone. 

For starters you will learn how to set up a simple grid and how to create the main shape using the Rounded Rectangle Tool. Next, you''ll learn how to ease your work with a simple script and the use of that Align stroke to pixel grid feature. Taking full advantage of the Effects pane, you will learn how how to create the colored lines. 

Finally, you'll learn how to add a bunch of text and how to stylize it. 




##Step 1

First of all you need to install a new font. Download the [Ubuntu Mono Bold font](http://font.ubuntu.com/) and drop it inside your Dropbox/iCloud folder. Tap the   plus button from the top-left corner and use that **Import from...** button to easily add your Ubuntu Mono Bold font.

##Step 2

Tap again that plus button to create a new document. Tap the **Create Document** button and then choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar**, tap that ruler icon to open the **Properties** panel and then tap the **Canvas** pane. Set both **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit and make sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled, for now.

Re-open the **Properties** panel and this time tap the **Grid** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open the **Grid Settings** pane and enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 3

Focus on the **Toolbar** and  notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the line color is set to black. 

Tap the **Fill** color well and set its color to **R=54 G=54 B=65** and then then tap the **Line** color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**. This will simply make your line invisible. Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, focus on the newly opened **Tool Options** pane and drag the **Radius** slider to **5**. Move to your canvas and create a **310 x 340 px** shape.

##Step 4

Return to your **Toolbar**, tap the **Fill** color and make it invisible and then tap the **Line** color, make it black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**) and drag the **Alpha** slider to **100%**. 

Using the **Pen Tool** or the **Line Tool**, create a **220 px**, vertical path and place it exactly as shown in the following image. Make sure that it stays selected, focus on the right side of your Titlebar and tap  the leftmost icon to open the **Appearance** panel. Go to the **Effects** pane and select the existing **Stroke**. Make sure that the **Width** is set to **1 pt**  and then check that **Round Cap** button.

##Step 5

Make sure that your vertical path is still selected and then tap and hold to open that context menu. Use the **Copy** and **Paste** commands to easily duplicate your vertical path. Select the copy and place it exactly as shown in the first image. Leave a **20 px** gap between this copy and the original path. Once again, the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work. 

Create another eight copies and spread them  exactly as shown in the second image. Make sure that there's always a **20 px** gap between each path.

##Step 6

Pick the **Path Selection Tool**, focus on the newly opened **Tool Options** pane and activate the **Add to Selection** mode. Select all your vertical paths and switch to the **Rotate Tool**. 

Go to the  new **Tool Options** pane, set the **Angle** to **90 degrees**  and then tap that **Copy** button. In the end, things should look like in the second image.

##Step 7

If you choose to export your design as an image you will notice that those horizontal and vertical lines end up looking pretty blurry. This  happens because the strokes applies for those lines are not perfectly aligned to the pixels grid.  To fix this issue, just go to the **Canvas** pane and activate that **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature. 

(image: lineChartiPhone7.jpg)


##Step 8

Pick the **Path Selection Tool** and activate the **Add to Selection** mode. 

Select all your vertical and hotizontal paths and go to the **Path Tools** pane from the **Properties** panel. Click that **Outline Stroke** command and then go to the **Combine** pane from the **Properties** panel. Click that **Union** command and make sure that the resulting shape remains selected. 

Open the **Effects** pane from the **Appearnace** panel and simply replace the existing **Fill** color with **R=44 G=44 B=54**.

##Step 9
Make sure that the shape made in the previous step is still selected, focus on the **Effects** pane and check the  box that stands for the existing **Drop Shadow** effect to enable it. 

Enter **1** in the **X** and **Y** boxes, drag the **Blur** slider to **0**  and then tap  the color well that stands for this effect. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **15%** and set the color to white (**R=255 G=255 B=255**).
