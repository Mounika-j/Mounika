In the following tutorial you will learn how to create an iPod Shuffle illustration in  Graphic for Mac. 

For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid, how to create the main shape and how to deal with complex gradients. Taking full advantage of the Effects pane and using some basic blending techniques, you will learn how to add subtle shading and highlights for your shapes.
 
Finally, taking full advantage of the Snap to Grid feature you will learn how to create the tiny symbols. 





##Step 1

Go to **File &gt; New (Command + N)** to bring up the **New Document** window. Select the **Grid** document style, set the document units to **pixels**, and set the document dimensions to **600** pixels wide by **600** pixels high.

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. If the **Properties** panel is not currently visible, you can easily open it using the ruler icon that lies above the **Layers** panel. Change the grid **X Spacing** and **Y Spacing** to **10**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0** and enable **Snap to Grid (Command + Shift + ')**.

Keep in mind that you can quickly enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature using the  **Command +  '** and  **Command + Shift + '** keyboard shortcuts.

##Step 2

Focus on the Toolbar and  notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the stroke color is set to black. Click  the **Fill** color well and set it to balck (**R=0 G=0 B=0**) and then click the **Stroke** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this will simply make your stroke invisible. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)**, focus on your **Tool Options** bar and set the **Corner Radius** to **2 pt**. Move to your canvas and  create a **140 x 130 px** shape- the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.

##Step 3

Make sure that your rounded rectangle stays selected and focus on the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel. If the **Appearance** panel is not currently visible, you can easily open it using the leftmost icon that lies above the **Layers** panel.

 Click that **Fill** and select **Linear Gradient** from the **Type** drop-down menu. Set the angle to **0 degrees** then move to the gradient sliders. Select the left one and set its color at **R=131 G=133 B=132** and thne select the right one and add the same color.

##Step 4

Make sure that your rounded rectangle stays selected and keep your eyes on the **Effects** pane. Keep focusing on the linear gradient applied to that **Fill** and simply click on that gradient bar to add a new gradient slider. Select it, set the color to **R=226 G=226 B=227** and then drag it to the left until the **Location** tooltip shows **3%**. Using the same technique add a fourth gradient slider for your gradient. Select it, set the same color (**R=226 G=226 B=227**) and drag it to **98%**.

##Step 6

Make sure that your rounded rectangle stays selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** pane and add a second fill using the plus button that lies in the bottom, left corner of the panel. 

Keep focusing on the new fill, click on its right side handle and drag it below the one that already exists. Expand it, set the **Type** to **Linear Gradient** and change the **Blend** to **Color Burn**. Move to the **Angle** box and set it to **90 degrees**, and then  move to the gradient sliders. Select the left one, set its color to black and drag the **Alpha** slider to **10%**, and then select the right one, set its color to white and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**.

##Step 7

Make sure that your rounded rectangle stays selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** pane and add a third **Fill** using that same plus button. 

Make sure that this new **Fill** lies below the other two and then select it. Set the **Type** to **Linear Gradient** and change the **Blend** to **Soft Light**. Set the **Angle** to **90 degrees** and then  move to the gradient sliders. Select the left one, move it to **50%**, set the color to white and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**. Move to the right gradient slider, select it, set the color to white and drag that **Alpha** slider to **30%**.

##Step 10

Get back to your Toolbar, make sure that the **Stroke** is invisible and then set the **Fill** color to **R=37 G=38 B=38**. Pick the **Ellipse Tool (O)**, create a **110 px** circle and place it as shown int he first image. Holding the **Shift** key will make it  easier for you to create a perfect circle. 

Replace the existing **Fill** color with a random red and make sure that the **Ellipse Tool (O)** is still active. Create a **70 px** circle and place it as shown in the second image. Using the **Move Tool (V)** and holding down the **Shift** key, select both shapes made in this step. Focus on the **Path Tools** pane from the **Properties** panel and simply click that **Subtract** button. In the end your new shape should look like in the fourth image.
