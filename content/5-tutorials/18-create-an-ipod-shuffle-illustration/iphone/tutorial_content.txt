In the following tutorial you will learn how to create an iPod Shuffle illustration in  Graphic for iPhone. 

For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid, how to create the main shape and how to deal with complex gradients. Taking full advantage of the Effects pane and using some basic blending techniques, you will learn how to add subtle shading and highlights for your shapes. 

Finally, taking full advantage of the Snap to Grid feature you will learn how to create the tiny symbols.




##Step 1

Start by tapping the   plus button from the top-left corner of your screen to create a new document. Tap the **Create Document** button and then choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar**, tap that ruler icon to open the **Properties** panel and then tap the **Canvas** pane. Set both **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and be sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled. When  this setting is enabled, stroked objects are offset slightly to ensure that the  stroke is drawn aligned to the pixel grid which guarantees a crisp look.

Re-open the **Properties** panel and this time tap the **Grid** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open the **Grid Settings** pane, enter **10 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and   notice that by default the **Fill** color is set to white while the **Line** color is set to black. Tap the **Fill** color well and set its color to black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**) and then tap the **Line** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this  will simply make your line invisible. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, focus on the newly opened **Tool Options** pane and drag the  **Radius** slider to **2**. Move to yor canvas and simply create a **140 x 130 px** shape - the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.

##Step 3

Make sure that your rounded rectangle stays selected, focus on the right side of the Titlebar and tap the leftmost icon to open the **Appearance** panel. Go to the **Effects** pane, tap that **Fill** color well and then tap the **Gradient ** button. Tap the **Linear** button, set the **Angle** to **0 degrees** and then move to the gradient sliders. Select the left one and set its color to **R=131 G=133 B=132** and then select the right one and add the same color.

##Step 4

Make sure that your rounded rectangle stays selected and keep your eyes on the **Effects** pane. 

Keep focusing on the linear gradient applied to that **Fill** and simply tap on that gradient bar to add a new gradient slider. Select it, set the color to **R=226 G=226 B=227** and then drag it to the left until the **Location** tooltip shows **3%**. Using the same technique, add a fourth gradient slider for your gradient. Select it, set the same color (**R=226 G=226 B=227**) and drag it to **98%**.

##Step 5

Make sure that your rounded rectangle stays selected and keep your eyes on the **Effects** pane. Keep focusing on the linear gradient applied to that **Fill**, add four new gradient sliders and then use the color and the location attributes shown in the following image.

##Step 6

Make sure that your rounded rectangle stays selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** pane and add a second **Fill** using the plus button that lies in the top, right corner of the pane. Tap on this new fill's right side handle and drag  it below the one that already exists. 

Once you're done, tap the color well that stands for your new **Fill**. Tap the **Gradient ** and the **Linear**  buttons, set the **Angle** to **-90 degrees** and then  move to the gradient sliders. Select the left one, set its color to black and drag the **Alpha** slider to **10%** and then select the right one, set its color to white and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**. Return to the **Effects** pane and tap the cogwheel icon that stands for your new **Fill**. Tap **Blend Mode** and  select **Color Burn** from that list.

##Step 7

Make sure that your rounded rectangle stays selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** pane and add a third **Fill** using that same plus button. 

Make sure that this new **Fill** lies below the other two and then tap its color well. Again, tap the **Gradient ** and then **Linear** buttons. Set the **Angle** to **-90 degrees** and then  move to the gradient sliders. Select the left one, move it to **50%**, set the color to white and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**. Move to the right gradient slider, select it, set the color to white and drag that **Alpha** slider to **30%**. Return to the **Effects** pane and tap the cogwheel icon of the fill added in this step. Tap **Blend Mode** and  select **Soft Light** from that list.

Replace the existing **Fill** color with a random red and make sure that the **Ellipse Tool** is still active. Create a **70 px** circle and place it as shown in the second image. Pick the **Path Selection Tool**, focus on the newly opened **Tool Options** pane and activate the **Add to Selection** mode.
