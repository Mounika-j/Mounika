In the following tutorial you will learn how to create an iPod Shuffle illustration in  Graphic for iPad. 

For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid, how to create the main shape and how to deal with complex gradients. Taking full advantage of the Effects pane and using some basic blending techniques, you will learn how to add subtle shading and highlights for your shapes. 

Finally, taking full advantage of the Snap to Grid feature you will learn how to create the tiny symbols.
  
  
  
  
  
##Step 1

From the **Documents Browser**, tap the plus button at the top-left corner of the **Titlebar** and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. Go to the **Canvas** pane, set the **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and make sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled. When  this setting is enabled, stroked objects are offset slightly to ensure that the  stroke is drawn aligned to the pixel grid which guarantees a crisp look.

Next, you need to setup the document grid. Tap again that **Settings** icon and switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open that **Grid Settings** pane, enter **10 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and   notice that by default the **Fill** color is set to white while the **Line** color is set to black. Tap the **Fill** color well and set its color to black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**) and then tap the **Line** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this  will simply make your line invisible. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, focus on the newly opened **Tool Options** pane and drag the  **Radius** slider to **2**. Move to yor canvas and simply create a **140 x 135 px** shape - the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.

##Step 3

Make sure that your rounded rectangle stays selected, focus on the right side of the Titlebar and  tap the leftmost icon. Move to the **Effects** pane and tap the **Fill** color well. Tap the **Gradient Fill** and the **Linear** buttons, set the **Angle** to **0 degrees** and then move to the gradient sliders. Select the left one and set its color to **R=131 G=133 B=132** and then select the right one and add the same color.

##Step 4

Make sure that your rounded rectangle stays selected and keep your eyes on the **Effects** pane. Keep focusing on the linear gradient applied to that  **Fill** and simply tap on that gradient bar to add a new gradient slider. Select it, set the color to **R=226 G=226 B=227** and then drag it to the left until the **Location** tooltip shows **3%**. Using the same technique, add a fourth gradient slider for your gradient. Select it, set the same color (**R=226 G=226 B=227**) and drag it to **98%**.

##Step 5

##Step 6

Make sure that your rounded rectangle stays selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** pane and add a second **Fill** using the plus button that lies in the bottom, right corner of the pane. Tap on this new fill's right side handle and drag  it below the one that already exists. 

Once you're done, tap the color well that stands for your new **Fill**. Tap the **Gradient Fill** and the **Linear Gradient** buttons, set the **Angle** to **-90 degrees** and then  move to the gradient sliders. Select the left one, set its color to black and drag the **Alpha** slider to **10%** and then select the right one, set its color to white and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**. Return to the **Effects** pane and tap the cogwheel icon that stands for your new **Fill**. Tap **Blend Mode**, select  **Color Burn** from that list and then tap that **Done** button.

Make sure that this new **Fill** lies below the other two and then tap its color well. Again, tap the **Gradient Fill** and then **Linear** button. Set the **Angle** to **-90 degrees** and then  move to the gradient sliders. Select the left one, move it to **50%**, set the color to white and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**. Move to the right gradient slider, select it, set the color to white and drag that **Alpha** slider to **30%**. Return to the **Effects** pane and tap the cogwheel icon that stands for this new **Fill**. Tap **Blend Mode** from the newly opened context menu,  select  **Soft Light** from that list, and then tap that **Done** button.
