In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a square glowing button in Graphic for Mac. 

For starters you will learn how to create a simple, dark background and how to easily center it. Using a rounded rectangle, a bunch of strokes and effects you will learn how to create the first part of your button. For the second part of your button you will need a new rounded rectangle with a thick, blue stroke, some effects and basic blending techniques. 

Finally, you will learn how to add a simple piece of text and how to easily recolor your button. 





##Step 1

For this tutorial we'll create a new **600 x 600 pixel** document. Go to **File &gt; New** or hit the **Command + N** keyboard shortcut to bring up the **New Document** window. Select the **Grid** document style, select **pixels** for the document unit and then set the document dimensions to **600** pixels wide by **600** pixels high.

Next, you need to adjust  the document's grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. If the **Properties** pane is not currently visible, you can easily open it using the ruler icon that lies above the **Layers** panel. Change the grid **X Spacing** and **Y Spacing** to **5**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0** and then enable **Snap to Grid**. 

Keep in mind that you can quickly enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature using the  **Command +  '** and  **Command + Shift + '** keyboard shortcuts.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and you will notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the stroke color is set to black. 

Click  the fill color well and replace the existing color with **R=29 G=29 B=34** and then click the stroke color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**, which will simply make the stroke invisible. Pick the **Rectangle Tool (M)** and create a **600 px** square.

##Step 3

Make sure that your square is still selected, move to the **Alignment** pane from the **Properties** panel and simply click the **Horizontal Centers** and **Vertical Centers** buttons to bring your square in the center of the canvas.

##Step 5

Make sure that your rounded rectangle stays selected and focus on the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel. If the **Appearance** pane is not currently visible, you can click on the leftmost icon that lies above the **Layers** pane to show and hide the panel.  

Click the color well that stands for the existing **Stroke**, drag the **Alpha** slider to **2%** and make sure that the color is set to black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**). Keep focusing on this stroke, drag the **Width** slider to **3 pt** and then select **Inside** from the **Position** drop-down menu.

Remember that you can easily move attributes inside the **Effects** pane using the button made out of three horizontal lines that comes with every attribute. Simply tap  and hold the button which stands for the attribute that you wish to be moved and then drag it wherever you want.
