In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a square glowing button in Graphic for iPhone. 

For starters you will learn how to create a simple, dark background and how to easily center it. Using a rounded rectangle, a bunch of strokes and effects you will learn how to create the first part of your button. For the second part of your button you will need a new rounded rectangle with a thick, blue stroke, some effects and basic blending techniques. 

Finally, you will learn how to add a simple piece of text and how to easily recolor your button. 






##Step 1

Start by tapping the   plus button from the top-left corner of your screen to create a new document. Tap the **Create Document** button and then choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar**, tap that ruler icon to open the **Properties** panel and then tap the **Canvas** pane. Set both **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and be sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is enabled. This feature ensures that all shapes that are aligned to the pixel grid will have solid, crisp strokes.

Re-open the **Properties** panel and this time tap the **Grid** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open the **Grid Settings** pane and enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and you will notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the line color is set to black. Tap the fill color wheel and replace the existing color with **R=29 G=29 B=34** and then tap  the line color wheel and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**, which will simply make your line invisible. Pick the **Rectangle Tool** and create a **600 px** square.
