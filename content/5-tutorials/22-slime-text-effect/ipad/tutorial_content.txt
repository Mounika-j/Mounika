In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a slime text effect using Graphic's tools and effects, particularly the Brush Tool and pressure-sensitive brush strokes using the Apple Pencil. Graphic takes full advantage of the Apple Pencil to draw beautiful pressure-sensitive brush strokes on the iPad Pro.

##Step 1

For this tutorial you will need to import the [BlackFat font](http://www.dafont.com/blackfat.font). Download this font and save it inside your Dropbox folder or iCloud Drive. Open Graphic and focus on the **Titlebar**. Tap the **Import** button, pick Dropbox or iCloud, locate your font and select it, and then simply tap the **Import** button.

Now, let's create a new document. First, tap that plus button and then select the Blank canvas style. For this tutorial you'll need a **680 x 500 px** document. 

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap that **Settings** icon. In the **Canvas** panel set the **Width** to **680 px** and the **Height** to **500 px**, select **Pixels** for the base units, and verify that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is enabled. When this setting is enabled, stroked objects are offset slightly to ensure that the stroke is drawn aligned to the pixel grid which guarantees a crisp look.

##Step 2

Pick the **Text Tool** and  double tap inside that text field to get the **Text** pane. Select the BlackFat font, increase the font size to **170**, set the color to **R=119 G=193 B=56** and then add the &quot;_Slime_&quot; piece of text. Using the **Move Tool**, drag your piece of text roughly in the center of the canvas. Now, move to the right side of your titlebar and tap the rightmost icon to open the **Layers** panel. Double tap the name of the existing layer and rename it &quot;_green_&quot;.

##Step 3

Keep focusing on the **Layers** panel and add a second layer using the plus button located at the top, right corner of this panel. Make sure that this new layer stays selected and rename it &quot;_outlines_&quot;.

Pick the **Brush Tool**  and first focus on the larger tool pane. Drag the **Width** slider to **8**, lower the **Smoothing** to **5%** and then tap the other tool pane to open the **Brush Settings** pane. Set the **Roundness** to **100%**, the **Angle** to **45 degrees** and the **Max Width** to **0%**. Move to the **Contour**, make sure that both draggable handles are placed in the top corners and then enable the **Use Pressure** feature. Keep in mind that the **Use Pressure** feature can only be used on an iPad Pro together with an Apple Pencil. This allows your Apple Pencil to apply pressure values to each drawn brushstroke.

Move to your toolbar and replace the existing stroke color with **R=26 G=77 B=0**. Focus on the first letter from your   text and draw smooth paths  along its edges roughly as shown in the following image. Try to vary the pressure on your pencil, use multiple brush strokes in your trace and make sure that you're not leaving parts of that green text on the outer side of your final trace.

##Step 4

Move to the rest of the text and use the same brush and techniques mentioned in the previous step.

##Step 6

Return to the **Layers** panel, add a third layer, drag it to the top of the panel and rename it &quot;_gaps_&quot;. Make sure that it stays selected, pick the **Brush Tool** and focus on the tool pane. Drag the **Width** slider to **1**, keep the **Smoothing**  set to **5%** and then open the **Brush Settings** pane.

Disable the **Use Pressure** feature, enter all the attributes shown in the following image and then move to the **Saved Brushes** pane to save your brush. Focus on the bottom, right corner of this pane and simply tap the **Save Brush** button which will add your brush to the top of the list.

Now, pick a random red for the stroke color, move to your canvas and simply draw a bunch of paths around the white areas left inside your tracings. Don't bother to close these paths or to make them perfect. Just make sure that the start and end points lie above your green piece of text and that the paths don't go over the edge of those traces.

##Step 7

Move to the **Layers** panel, and enable 'Select Multiple Layers' using the button at the bottom of the pane. This will allow you to select more than one layer at a time. Select the &quot;_gaps_&quot; and the &quot;_green_&quot; layers and return to the bottom side of your **Layers** panel.  Tap that cogwheel icon and go to **Merge Layers**.

##Step 8

Keep focusing on the **Layers** panel, open your &quot;_green_&quot; layer, select that piece of text and then close the panel. Focus on the right side of your titlebar and tap the middle icon. Go to the **Path** panel and simply tap the **Convert Text to Outlines**. Make sure that the resulting shapes remain selected and move to the **Combine** panel. First, tap the **Union** command and then tap the **Make Compound Path** command.

##Step 9

Using the **Move Tool**, select all the shapes that are part of your &quot;_green_&quot; layer and go to the **Combine** panel. Again, start with the **Union** command and then tap the **Make Compound Path** command. In the end there should be only this compound path inside your &quot;_green_&quot; layer.

##Step 10

Make sure that your green compound path stays selected, focus on the right side of your titlebar and tap the leftmost icon. 

Move to the **Effects** panel and tap the existing **Stroke**. Drag the  **Width** slider to **5 pt**, set the **Position** to **Inside**, check the **Round Cap** and the **Round Join** buttons and then tap the stroke color to open the color panel. Make sure that the color is set to black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**) and drag the **Alpha** slider to **15%**.

Return to the **Effects** pane and tap the cogwheel icon next to the stroke effect. Go to **Blend Mode**, select the **Soft Light** blend mode and then tap the **Done** button. The blend mode for an effect can always be seen at the bottom, left corner of the **Effects** pane.

##Step 18

Focus on the **Layers** panel, add a new layer and name it &quot;_white_&quot;. Drag it to the top of the panel and make sure that it stays selected.

Pick the **Brush Tool**, drag the **Width** slider to **2**, keep the  **Smoothing** at **5%** and then open the **Saved Brushes** pane. Select the top, default brush, set the stroke color to white and then draw several, subtle paths above the dripping section from your text roughly as shown in the following image. 

(image: SlimeTextiPad18.jpg)



##Step 19

Move to the **Layers** panel, make sure that your &quot;_white_&quot; layer is selected, focus on the bottom side of the panel and then simply change the **Blend Mode**  to **Overlay** and drag the **Alpha** slider to **50%**. 

(image: SlimeTextiPad19.jpg)



##Step 20

Return to  the **Layers** panel,  add a new layer and name it &quot;_black_&quot;. Drag it to the top of the panel and make sure that it stays selected.

Pick the **Brush Tool**  and make sure that the  brush used in the previous step is still active. Set the stroke color to black and then draw several, subtle paths below the dripping section from your text roughly as shown in the following image.

##Step 22

Focus on the **Layers** panel,  add a new layer and name it &quot;_dots 3_&quot;. Drag it to the top of the panel and make sure that it stays selected.

Pick the **Brush Tool**, drag the **Width** slider to **3**, keep the **Smoothing** at **5%** and then open the **Saved Brushes** pane. Select the brush that you saved in the beginning of the tutorial, set the stroke color to white and then simply tap on your canvas to easily add a **3 px** wide dot. Use this technique to add a bunch of similar dots and spread them roughly as shown in the following image.

##Step 23


Move to the **Layers** panel, make sure that your &quot;_dots 3_&quot; layer is still selected change its **Blend Mode**  to **Overlay** and drag the **Alpha** slider to **30%**. 

(image: SlimeTextiPad23.jpg)



##Step 24

Focus on the **Layers** panel,  add a new layer and name it &quot;_dots 2_&quot;. Drag it to the top of the panel and make sure that it stays selected.

Pick the **Brush Tool** and  decrease the **Width** slider to **2 pt**. Move to your canvas and add a bunch of **2 px** dots near those **3 px** dots roughly as shown in the following image. 

(image: SlimeTextiPad24.jpg)



##Step 25

Move to the **Layers** panel, make sure that your &quot;_dots 2_&quot; layer is still selected change its **Blend Mode**  to **Overlay** and drag the **Alpha** slider to **30%**. 

(image: SlimeTextiPad25.jpg)



##Step 26

Focus on the **Layers** panel,  add a new layer and name it &quot;_hair_&quot;. Drag it to the top of the panel and make sure that it stays selected.

Pick the **Brush Tool**, drag the **Width** slider to **1 pt**, keep the **Smoothing** at **5%** and then open the **Brush Settings** pane. Drag the **Roundness** slider to **100%**, ignore the other two attributes and then move to the **Contour**. Select the left end of that orange path and drag it to the top, left corner and then select the other end and drag it to the bottom, right corner. These points simply set the level of thickness that your brush should have at the start and end points, but you can easily add more points along the path to create more complex brushes. Simply double tap on the orange path whenever you wish to add more points for your brush.

Now, set the stroke color to **R=47 G=28 B=23** and use this brush to add some tiny hair pieces across your text as shown in the following image.
