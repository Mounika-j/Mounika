In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a slime text effect using Graphic's tools and effects, particularly the Brush Tool and pressure-sensitive brush strokes. 

Graphic can be used together with any Mac-compatible drawing tablet to draw beautiful pressure-sensitive brush strokes. If no graphic tablet is available, Graphic can also take advantage of Apple’s pressure-sensitive trackpads.

##Step 1

For this tutorial we'll create a new **680 x 500 px** document. Choose **File &gt; New (Command + N)** to bring up the **New Document** window. Select the **Blank** document style, set the document units to **pixels**, and set the document dimensions to **680** pixels wide by **500** pixels high.

##Step 2

Pick the **Text Tool (T)**, simply click on you canvas and then focus on the **Text** section from the **Appearance** pane. Simply click that round, info icon located above the **Layers** panel whenever you wish to open/close the **Appearance** pane. 

Select the [BlackFat font](http://www.dafont.com/blackfat.font), set the size to **170 pt** and then simply add your &quot;_Slime_&quot; piece of text and set its color to **R=119 G=193 B=56**. Move to the **Layers** panel, double click on the existing layer and rename it &quot;_green_&quot;.

##Step 3

Keep focusing on the **Layers** panel and add a second layer using the plus button located in the bottom, left corner of this pane. Make sure that this new layer stays selected and rename it &quot;_outlines_&quot;.

Now, pick the **Brush Tool (B)** and focus on the tool options bar. Drag the **Width** slider to **8 pt**, lower the **Smoothing** to **5%** and select **Use Pressure** from that second drop-down menu. Keep in mind that the **Use Pressure** feature can be used along with a graphics tablet or with the Mac’s trackpad, and it simply allows your pen to tell the system the amount of pressure that is applied.

Move to your toolbar and replace the existing stroke color with **R=26 G=77 B=0**. Focus on the first letter from your   text and draw smooth paths  along its edges roughly as shown in the following image. Try to vary the pressure on your pen, use multiple brush strokes in your trace and make sure that you're not leaving parts of that green text on the outer side of your final trace.

##Step 4

Move to the rest of the text and use the same brush and techniques mentioned in the previous step.

##Step 5

Add some dripping paths over your text roughly as shown in the following image.

##Step 6

Return to your **Layers** panel and add a third layer. Drag it to the top of the panel and rename it &quot;_gaps_&quot;. Make sure that it stays selected, pick the **Brush Tool (B)** and focus on the tool options bar.

Drag the **Width** slider to **1 pt**, keep the **Smoothing** at **5%**, select **Fixed Width** from the second drop-down menu and then open the **Brush Settings** fly-out window. Drag the **Roundness** slider to **100%**, ignore the other two sliders and then move to the **Contour** section. Select the left end of that orange path and drag it to the top, left corner and then select the other end and drag it to the top, right corner. These points simply set the level of thickness that your brush should have in  the starting point and in the ending point, but you can easily add such points along the path thus creating more complex brushes. Simply double click on the orange path whenever you wish to add more points to your brush. You'll need to use this brush again, so simply save it using the **Save Brush**.

Now, pick a random red for the stroke color, move to your canvas and simply draw a bunch of paths around the  white areas left inside your tracings. Don't bother to close these paths or to make them perfect. Just make sure that the start and end points lie above your green piece of text and that the paths don't go over the edge of those traces.

##Step 7

Focus on the **Layers** pane and select both the "_gaps_" and the "_green_” layers by clicking on them while holding down the **Shift** key. Right click on one of these two layers and go to **Merge Layers**.

##Step 8
Keep focusing on the **Layers** panel, open your &quot;_green_&quot; layer, select that piece of text and go to **Modify &gt; Convert Text to Outlines**. Make sure that the resulting shapes remain selected, open the **Properties** pane and go to  the **Path Tools** section. First, click the **Union** button and then click the **Make Compound Path** button.

##Step 10

Make sure that your green compound path stays selected and focus on the **Stroke** section from the **Appearance** pane. Drag the **Line Weight** slider to **5 pt**, set the **Position** to **Inside**, check the **Round Cap** and the **Round Join** buttons and then click the stroke color. Make sure that the color is set to black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**) and drag the **Alpha** slider to **15%**. Move to the **Effects** section from the **Appearance** pane, keep focusing on that **Stroke** and change its **Blend Mode** to **Soft Light**.
