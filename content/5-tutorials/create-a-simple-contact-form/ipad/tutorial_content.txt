In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a simple contact form in Graphic for iPad. 

For starters, you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create the main shapes using basic tool like the Rounded Rectangle Tool, the Rectangle Tool and the Path Selection Tool. Next, you'll learn how to group and organize your shapes and how to add subtle shading and highlights for your shapes. 

Finally, you'll learn how to create and stylize pieces of text. 





##Step 1

From the **Documents Browser**, tap the plus button at the top-left corner of the **Titlebar** and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. In the **Canvas** pane set the **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base units, and verify that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled.

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** pane in the **Settings** popover. Ensure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or **Snap to Grid**. Finally, simply tap the **Grid Spacing** pane, enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar**, tap the **Fill** color well and set its color to **R=0 G=124 B=215** and then  tap the **Line** color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**. This will simply make your line invisible. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, focus on the newly opened tool pane and drag the  **Radius** slider to 1**0**. Move to yor canvas and  create a **300 x 370 px** shape. The grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.
