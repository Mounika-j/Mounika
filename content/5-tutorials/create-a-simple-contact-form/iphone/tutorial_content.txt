In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a simple contact form in Graphic for iPhone. 

For starters, you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create the main shapes using basic tool like the Rounded Rectangle Tool, the Rectangle Tool and the Path Selection Tool. Next, you'll learn how to group and organize your shapes and how to add subtle shading and highlights for your shapes. Finally, you'll learn how to create and stylize pieces of text. 





##Step 1

Start by tapping the   plus button from the top-left corner of your screen to create a new document. Tap the **Create Document** button and then choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the **Toolbar**, tap the **Fill** color well and set its color to **R=0 G=124 B=215** and then  tap the **Line** color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**. This will simply make your line invisible.
