In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a simple contact form in Graphic for Mac. 

For starters, you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create the main shapes using basic tool like the Rounded Rectangle Tool, the Rectangle Tool and the Path Selection Tool. Next, you'll learn how to group and organize your shapes and how to add subtle shading and highlights for your shapes. 

Finally, you'll learn how to create and stylize pieces of text. 





##Step 1

Go to **File &gt; New (Command + N)** to bring up the **New Document** pane. Select the **Grid** document style, set the document units to **pixels**, and set the document dimensions to **600 pixels** wide by **600 pixels** high.

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. If the **Properties** panel is not currently visible, you can easily open it using the ruler icon that lies above the **Layers** panel. Change the grid **X Spacing** and **Y Spacing** to **5 px**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0 px** and enable **Snap to Grid (Command + Shift + ')**.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar**, click  the fill color well and set the  color to **R=0 G=124 B=215**. Next, click  the stroke color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**, which will simply make the stroke invisible. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)**, focus on the Tool Options bar and drag the **Corner Radius** slider to 1**0 pt**. Move to yor canvas and simply create a **300 x 370px** shape. The grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.
