In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a fashion store product page in Graphic for Mac. 

For starters you will learn how to set up a simple grid and how to import &amp; edit photos in Graphic. You will learn how to mask shapes or images and how to easily adjust them. Using basic tools, you will learn how to create the main vector shapes. Moving on, you will learn how to add subtle shading using the Effects pane and how to cleverly use the Label feature. 

You'll learn how to increase your work speed with the aid of the Snap to Grid and the Smart Guides features and how to add and adjust text fields. Finally, you will learn how to import and edit several SVG files. 





##Step 1

For this tutorial we'll create a **3000 x 1900 px** document. Go to **File &gt; New (Command + N)** to bring up the **New Document** panel. Select the **Grid** document style and set the document units to **pixels**. Set the document dimensions to **3000** pixels wide by **1900** pixels high and then click **Choose** to create your document. 

Next, we'll adjust the document grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. You can easily open or close the **Properties** panel using that ruler icon. Change the **X** &amp; **Y Spacing** to **10**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0** and don't forget to enable **Snap to Grid**—all these features will make your work easier.

Keep in mind that you can quickly enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature using the  **Command + '** and the  **Command + Shift + '** keyboard shortcuts.

##Step 2

Open your web browser and download the **3888 x 2592** version of [this jeans photo](https://pixabay.com/en/jeans-vintage-zara-boyfriends-792049/#_=_).

##Step 3

Simply drag the jeans photo inside your Graphic document and make sure that it stays selected.

Go to the **Geometry** pane from the **Properties** panel. Make sure that the aspect ratio is locked and simply set the **Width** to **3360 px**. 

Move to the **Alignment** pane from the **Properties** panel and then click the **Horizontal Centers** and the **Vertical Centers** commands to easily move your image in the center of the canvas.

##Step 4

Make sure that your image is still selected and go to the **Effect** pane from the **Appearance** panel – click the leftmost inspector panel icon to open or close the **Appearance** panel whenever you want. 

Focus on the existing **Blur** effect and check its little checkbox to activate it. Click this effect to expand it and drag that **Radius** slider to **25 pt**.

With your image still selected, simply hit **Command + C** to copy it. Alternatively, you can right click anywhere on your canvas and go to **Copy**.

##Step 5

Pick the **Move Tool (V)**, and click outside your selected image to deselect it. Focus on the **Toolbar** and click the **Stroke** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** which will simply make your **Stroke** invisible. Click the **Fill** color well and replace the existing color with **R=36 G=36 B=65**. 

Pick the **Rectangle Tool (M)**, focus on your canvas and create a **2700  x 1600 px** shape. Make sure that it stays selected and move it to the center of the canvas using the same **Horizontal Centers** and the **Vertical Centers** commands from the **Alignment** pane.

##Step 6

Make sure that your rectangle is still selected and focus on the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel. 

Activate the existing **Drop Shadow** effect and expand it. Enter **0 pt** in the **X** box and **50 pt** in the **Y** box, drag that **Size** slider to **50 pt**, and then click the color well of this effect. Replace the existing color with **R=33 G=33 B=63** and drag that **Alpha** slider to **80%**.

##Step 7

Open the **Layers** panel and add a second layer using the plus button from the bottom of the panel. Make sure that this new layer stays selected, as the new shapes you are about to create will go here.

Return to your **Toolbar** and set the **Fill** color to **R=139 G=195 B=0**. Using the **Rectangle Tool (M)**, create a **1340 x 1600 px** shape and place it as shown in the following image.

##Step 8
Simply hit **Command + V** to add a copy of that jeans photo. Make sure that this copy stays selected, go to the **Effects** pane and disable that **Blur** effect. 

Move to the **Geometry** pane and set the **Width** to **2430 px**. Focus on the **Position** attributes to numerically position your selection horizontally to **1020 px** and vertically to **140 px**. 
Once you're done, hit **Command + X** to cut your photo.

##Step 9

Using the **Move Tool (V)**, select your green rectangle and simply hit **Control + Command + V** (or go to **Edit &gt; Paste Inside**) to paste the photo cut in the previous step inside your green shape. Your green shape will act as a mask.
