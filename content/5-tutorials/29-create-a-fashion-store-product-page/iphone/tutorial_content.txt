In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a fashion store product page in Graphic for Mac. 

For starters you will learn how to set up a simple grid and how to import &amp; edit photos in Graphic. You will learn how to mask shapes or images and how to easily adjust them. Using basic tools, you will learn how to create the main vector shapes. Moving on, you will learn how to add subtle shading using the Effects pane and how to cleverly use the Label feature. 

You'll learn how to increase your work speed with the aid of the Snap to Grid and the Smart Guides features and how to add and adjust text fields. Finally, you will learn how to import and edit several SVG files. 





##Step 1

First, you need to download the [League Spartan font](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/league-spartan) and the [Montserrat-Thin font](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/montserrat) and this [set of SVG files](https://www.flaticon.com/packs/free-basic-ui-elements). Save them inside your **iCloud Drive** and then open Graphic.
