In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a fashion store product page in Graphic for Mac. If you happed to use Graphic on an iPad Pro will learn how to easily import images, fonts, text or files using the new drag and drop feature. 

For starters you will learn how to set up a simple grid and how to import &amp; edit photos in Graphic. You will learn how to mask shapes or images and how to easily adjust them. Using basic tools, you will learn how to create the main vector shapes. Moving on, you will learn how to add subtle shading using the Effects pane and how to cleverly use the Label feature. 

You'll learn how to increase your work speed with the aid of the Snap to Grid and the Smart Guides features and how to add and adjust text fields. Finally, you will learn how to import and edit several SVG files. 


##Step 1

First, you need to download the [League Spartan font](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/league-spartan) and the [Montserrat-Thin font](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/montserrat) and this [set of SVG files](https://www.flaticon.com/packs/free-basic-ui-elements). Save them inside your **iCloud Drive** and open Graphic. 

Next, you need to import those two fonts to make them available in Graphic. If you're using Graphic on an iPad Pro you can easily import these fonts using the drag and drop feature. Go to your Files app, tap the **League Spartan font** to highlight it and swipe up from the bottom of the screen to access the dock. Now, you can either tap Graphic or hover your dragged font over Graphic to open it. Once Graphic is opened, all you have to do is drop the font. Use the same technique to import the **Montserrat-Thin font**.

Don't worry, adding fonts in Graphic on an iPad that doesn't run iOS 11 or later is just as easy. Open Graphic and tap that **Import** button from the left side of the **Titlebar**. Tap the **Import from iCloud Drive** command to open your Files app and simply tap that **League Spartan font** to add it. Don't forget to also import the **Montserrat-Thin font**.

Now, let's create a new document. From the **Documents Browser**, tap the plus button at the top-left corner of the **Titlebar** and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. In the **Canvas** pane set the **Width** to **3000 px** and the **Height** to **1900 px**, select **Pixels** for the base units, and verify that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled. When this setting is enabled, stroked objects are offset slightly to ensure that the stroke is drawn aligned to the pixel grid which guarantees a crisp look.

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Tap again that **Settings** icon and switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** pane. 

Be sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid** feature.  Open the **Grid Settings** pane, enter **10 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.
