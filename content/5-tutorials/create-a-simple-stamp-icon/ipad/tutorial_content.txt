In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a simple stamp icon in Graphic for iPad. 

For starters you will learn how to setup a simply grid and how to create the main stamp shape using two simple tools, a bunch of shapes and some basic vector shapes building techniques. Next, you will learn how to add a simple background, how to easily center it and how to add a simple, radial gradient. Moving on, you will learn how to add subtle shading and highlights for your stamp shape. 

Finally, you will learn how to insert an inside inside a shape and how to easily adjust its attributes.





##Step 1

For this tutorial we'll create a new **600 x 600 pixel** document. From the **Documents Browser**, tap the plus button at the top-right corner of the **Titlebar** and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. Go to the **Canvas** panel, set the **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and make sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is enabled. The **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature ensures that all shapes which are aligned to the pixel grid will have solid, crisp strokes.

Next, you need to adjust your document's grid so switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** panel. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Open the **Grid Settings** pane, enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in that one **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and you will notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the line color is set to black. Tap the fill color wheel and set its color to **R=247 G=239 B=228** and then tap the line color wheel and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**, which will make your line invisible.  

Pick the **Rectangle Tool**, focus on your canvas and create a **135 x 150 px** shape. The grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.

##Step 3

Return to your **Toolbar**, make sure that the stroke is still invisible and then replace the existing fill color with **R=24 G=169 B=250**. 

Pick the **Ellipse Tool**, create a **10 px** circle and place it as shown in the following image. Once again, the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will come in handy.

##Step 4

Focus on the left side of your **Titlebar** and tap that paperclip icon to open the popover menu. Use the **Copy** and **Paste** commands to multiply your blue circle and spread the copies in a perfect column as shown in the following image.

##Step 12

Get back to your **Toolbar**, make sure that the stroke is still invisible and then set the fill color to **R=0 G=74 B=124**. 

Pick the **Rectangle Tool**, focus on your canvas and create a **600 px** square. Make sure that this new shape stays selected and focus on the **Arrange** panel. First, drag the **Order** slider to the left which will send your square to back and then tap the **Align Horizontal**  and **Align Vertical**  buttons  to easily bring your blue shape in the center of the canvas.

##Step 13

Make sure that your blue rectangle stays selected and move to the **Effects**  panel. 

Tap the color wheel that stands for the existing **Fill**, tap the **Gradient Fill** and **Radial** button, set the **Angle** to **0 degrees** and then move to the gradient sliders. Select the left one and set its color to **R=80 G=73 B=83** and then select the right one and set its color to **R=59 G=53 B=63**. 

Switch to the **Move Tool**, return to your canvas and simply double tap inside your square to activate the **Gradient Tool**.  Select the right gradient slider and  drag it to the right roughly as shown in the following image.

##Step 14

Select your stamp shape, focus on the **Effects** panel and select the existing **Stroke**. 

Drag the **Width** slider to **2 pt**, check the **Inside** **Alignment** button and then tap the color wheel that stands for this **Stroke**. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **100%** and replace the existing color with  white (**R=255 G=255 B=255**).

 Return to the **Effects** panel and tap the cogwheel icon that stands for the same **Stroke**. Go to **Blend Mode**, select the **Soft Light** blend mode and then tap the **Done** button.

##Step 15

Make sure that your stamp shape stays selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** panel and add a second **Stroke** using the plus button located in the bottom, right corner of your panel.

 Focus on this new **Stroke**, make sure that it lies below the existing one and then enter the attributes shown in the following image. You can easily move attributes inside the **Effects** panel using the button made out of three horizontal lines that comes with every attribute. Simply tap  and hold the button which stands for the attribute that you wish to be moved and then drag it wherever you want.

Enter **1** in the **Y** box and **0** in the other two boxes and then tap the color wheel that stands for this effect. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **15%** and make sure that the color is set to black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**). Keep focusing on the **Effects** panel and simply drag your **Drop Shadow** effect right below the **Fill**.

##Step 21

Now, you  need to save [this free image](http://pixabay.com/en/hawk-bird-prey-animal-nature-494064/) inside your Photos iPad folder. 

Reselect that yellow rectangle and focus on the **Appearance** panel. Open the **Image Fill** pane, tap the **Change Image** button and then simply add the image downloaded a few moments ago. You will probably notice that the image doesn't cover your entire rectangle, but this  issue can be solved pretty fast. 

Pick the **Move Tool**, make sure that your rectangle is still selected and double tap it to activate the **Image Tool**. Drag that **Image** slider slightly to the right until you can tell that your image covers the entire rectangle. Once you're done, simply tap outside your shape.

Make sure that your rectangle is still selected, re-open the **Image Fill** pane from the **Appearance** panel, tap that same **Change Image...** button and replace the existing image with the one that you prefer. Don't forget to adjust it and keep in mind that you can also adjust the position of the image when the **Image Tool** is active. Simply tap and drag it wherever you want.
