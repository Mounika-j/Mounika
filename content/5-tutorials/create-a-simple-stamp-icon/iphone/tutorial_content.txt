In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a simple stamp icon in Graphic for iPhone. 

For starters you will learn how to setup a simply grid and how to create the main stamp shape using two simple tools, a bunch of shapes and some basic vector shapes building techniques. Next, you will learn how to add a simple background, how to easily center it and how to add a simple, radial gradient. Moving on, you will learn how to add subtle shading and highlights for your stamp shape. 

Finally, you will learn how to insert an inside inside a shape and how to easily adjust its attributes.





##Step 1

Start by tapping the   plus button from the top-left corner of your screen to create a new document. Tap the **Create Document** button and then choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar**, tap that ruler icon to open the **Properties** panel and then tap the **Canvas** pane. Set both **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and be sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is enabled. This feature ensures that all shapes that are aligned to the pixel grid will have solid, crisp strokes.

Re-open the **Properties** panel and this time tap the **Grid** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open the **Grid Settings** pane and enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and you will notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the line color is set to black. Tap the fill color wheel and set its color to **R=247 G=239 B=228** and then tap the line color wheel and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**, which will make your line invisible. 
 
Pick the **Rectangle Tool**, focus on your canvas and create a **135 x 150 px** shape. The grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.

##Step 3

Return to your **Toolbar**, make sure that the stroke is still invisible and then replace the existing fill color with **R=24 G=169 B=250**. 

Pick the **Ellipse Tool**, create a **10 px** circle and place it as shown in the following image. Once again, the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will come in handy.

##Step 4

Make sure that your blue circle is still selected and then tap and hold until you get the dark tooltip. Use the **Copy** and **Paste** commands to multiply your blue circle and spread the copies in a perfect column as shown in the following image.

##Step 12

Get back to your **Toolbar**, make sure that the stroke is still invisible and then set the fill color to **R=0 G=74 B=124**. 

Pick the **Rectangle Tool**, focus on your canvas and create a **600 px** square. Make sure that this new shape stays selected and tap the **Arrange** pane from the **Properties** panel. Simply drag that slider to the left which will send your square to back, behind the existing shape. 

Make sure that your  square remained selected, re-open the **Properties** panel and this time open the **Align** pane. Tap the **Horizontal** and **Vertical**  buttons  to easily bring your  shape in the center of the canvas.

##Step 13

Make sure that your blue rectangle stays selected and tap the fill color wheel from the **Toolbar**. 

Tap the **Gradient**  button and then **Radial** icon, set the **Angle** to **0 degrees** and then move to the gradient sliders. Select the left one and set its color to **R=80 G=73 B=83** and then select the right one and set its color to **R=59 G=53 B=63**. 

Switch to the **Move Tool**, return to your canvas and simply double tap inside your square to activate the **Gradient Tool**.  Select the right gradient slider and  drag it to the right roughly as shown in the following image.

##Step 14

Select your stamp shape, focus on the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel and tap the existing **Stroke**. 

Drag the **Width** slider to **2 pt**, check the **Inside** **Alignment** button and then tap the color wheel that stands for this **Stroke**. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **100%** and replace the existing color with  white (**R=255 G=255 B=255**).

 Return to the **Effects** panel and tap the cogwheel icon that stands for the same **Stroke**. Go to **Blend Mode** and select the **Soft Light** blend mode.

You can easily move attributes inside the **Effects** panel using the button made out of three horizontal lines that comes with every attribute. Simply tap  and hold the button which stands for the attribute that you wish to be moved and then drag it wherever you want.

Drag the **Alpha** slider to **15%** and make sure that the color is set to black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**).
