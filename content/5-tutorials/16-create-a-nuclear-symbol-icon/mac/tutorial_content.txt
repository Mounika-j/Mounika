In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a simple nuclear symbol in  Graphic for Mac. 

For starters, you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to easily center your main shapes using the commands from the Alignment pane. Next, you will learn how to slice your shapes and how to create the actual symbol. 

Finally, you will learn how to create a gradient filled background and how to add subtle details for your final symbol. 





##Step 1

Go to **File &gt; New (Command + N)** to bring up the **New Document** window. Select the **Grid** document style, set the document units to **pixels**, and set the document dimensions to **600** pixels wide by **600** pixels high.

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. If the **Properties** panel is not currently visible, you can easily open it using the ruler icon that lies above the **Layers** panel. Change the grid **X Spacing** and **Y Spacing** to **10**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0** and enable **Snap to Grid (Command + Shift + ')**.

Keep in mind that you can quickly enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature using the  **Command +  '** and  **Command + Shift + '** keyboard shortcuts.

##Step 2

Focus on the Toolbar and  notice that by default the **Fill** color is set to white while the **Stroke** color is set to black. Click  the **Fill** color well and set it to **R=28 G=28 B=28** and then click the **Stroke** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this will simply make your stroke invisible. 

Pick the **Ellipse Tool (L)**, move to your canvas and  create a **220 px** circle- the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature should make it easier. Holding  the&nbsp;**Shift**&nbsp;key while clicking and dragging will create a perfect  circle.

Make sure that this shape stays selected, move to the **Alignement** pane from the **Properties** panel and simply click the **Horizontal Centers** and **Vertical Centers** buttons to easily center your selection.

##Step 3

Set the **Fill** color to **R=225 G=170 B=0** and make sure that the **Ellipse Tool (O)** is still active. 

Create a **180 px** circle, make sure that it stays selected and center it using the same **Horizontal Centers** and **Vertical Centers** buttons from the **Alignment** pane.

##Step 4

Set the **Fill** color to **R=1 G=152 B=246** and make sure that the **Ellipse Tool (O)** is still active. Create a **140 px** circle and center it.

##Step 5

Set the **Fill** color to white (**R=255 G=255 B=255**) and make sure that the **Ellipse Tool (O)** is still active. Create a **40 px** circle and center it.

##Step 6

Set the **Fill** color to **R=219 G=65 B=0** and make sure that the **Ellipse Tool (O)** is still active. Create a **20 px** circle and center it.

##Step 7

Using the **Move Tool (V)** and the **Shift** key, select the blue circle  along with the white one, focus on the **Path Tools** pane from the **Properties**  panel and click the **Subtract** button. In the end your blue shape should look like in the second image.

##Step 8
Set the **Fill** color to **R=0 G=90 B=150**, pick the **Rectangle Tool (M)**, create a **120 x 100 px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the first image. 

Focus on the bottom side of your new rectangle and switch to the **Path Selection Tool (A)**. Select the right anchor point and simply hit the **Delete** (or **Backspace**) key to remove it. Select the remaining, bottom anchor point and drag it **60 px** to the right. In the end your rectangle should turn into a simple triangle as shown in the second image.

##Step 9

Make sure that your triangle is still selected and switch to the **Rotate Tool (R)**. Focus on your triangle and you should notice a little cross right in the center of the shape, that's the reference point.  Drag it above the bottom corner of your triangle and then focus on the **Tool Options** bar. Set the **Angle** to **120 degrees**  and then simply click that **Copy** button twice.

##Step 10

##Step 12

Reselect your three blue shapes along with that tiny, orange circle, focus on the  **Path Tools** pane from the **Pathfinder** panel and simply click the **Make Compound Path** button. Make sure that your newly made compound path is selected, focus on the Toolbar and simply replace the existing **Fill** color with **R=29 G=29 B=29**.

##Step 13

Focus above the **Layers** pane and simply click the leftmost icon to open the **Appearance** pane. Select the compound path made in the previous step, go to the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel and simply check the  box that stands for the existing **Drop Shadow** to activate it. 

Enter **1** in the **Y** box and **0** in the other two boxes, change the **Blend Mode** to **Soft Light** and then click the color well of your **Drop Shadow**. Set the color to white (**R=255 G=255 B=255**) and then drag that **Alpha** slider to **70%**.

##Step 15

Select your yellow circle, focus on the **Effects** pane and select the existing **Stroke**. Set the **Width** to **1 pt** and the **Position** to **Inside** and then   click the color well of your **Stroke**. Replace the existing color with **R=180 G=135 B=5** and make sure that the **Alpha** slider is set to **100%**.

##Step 17

Using the **Rectangle Tool (M)**, create a **600 px** square, make sure that it stays selected and focus on the **Effects** pane. 

Focus on the **Fill** and select **Radial Gradient** from the **Type** drop-down menu. Set the angle to **0 degrees** and then move to the gradient sliders. Select the left one and set its color to **R=45 G=45 B=45** and then  select the right one and se its color to **R=25 G=25 B=25**. Send this shape to back using the **Shift + Command + [** keyboard shortcut and don't forget to center it.
