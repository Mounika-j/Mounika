In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a simple nuclear symbol in  Graphic for iPad. 

For starters, you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to easily center your main shapes using the commands from the Alignment pane. Next, you will learn how to slice your shapes and how to create the actual symbol. 

Finally, you will learn how to create a gradient filled background and how to add subtle details for your final symbol. 





##Step 1

From the **Documents Browser**, tap the plus button at the top-left corner of the **Titlebar** and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. Go to the **Canvas** pane, set the **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and make sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled. When  this setting is enabled, stroked objects are offset slightly to ensure that the  stroke is drawn aligned to the pixel grid which guarantees a crisp look.

Next, you need to setup the document grid. Switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open that **Grid Settings** pane, enter **10 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and   notice that by default the **Fill** color is set to white while the **Line** color is set to black. Tap the **Fill** color well and set its color to **R=28 G=28 B=28** and then tap the **Line** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this  will simply make your line invisible.
 
Pick the **Ellipse Tool**, move to yor canvas and  create a **220  px** circle - the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.

Make sure that this shape stays selected and focus on the right side of the Titlebar. Simply tap that middle icon, focus on the **Arrange** pane and tap the **Align Horizontal** and **Align Vertical** buttons.

##Step 3

Set the **Fill** color to **R=225 G=170 B=0** and make sure that the **Ellipse Tool**  is still active. Create a **180 px** circle and center it using the same **Align Horizontal** and **Align Vertical** buttons from the **Arrange** pane.

##Step 4

Set the **Fill** color to **R=1 G=152 B=246** and make sure that the **Ellipse Tool**  is still active. Create a **140 px** circle and center it.

##Step 5

Set the **Fill** color to white (**R=255 G=255 B=255**) and make sure that the **Ellipse Tool**  is still active. Create a **40 px** circle and center it.

##Step 6

Set the **Fill** color to **R=219 G=65 B=0** and make sure that the **Ellipse Tool**  is still active. Create a **20 px** circle and center it.

##Step 7

Pick  the **Path Selection Tool**, focus on the newly opened pane and activate the **Add to Selection** mode. This tool will allow you to easily select or add new shapes to an existing selection. Focus on your canvas, select the blue and the white circles, move to the **Combine** pane and tap the **Subtract** button. In the end your blue shape should look like in the second image.

##Step 8
Set the **Fill** color to **R=0 G=90 B=150**, pick the **Rectangle Tool**, create a **120 x 100 px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the first image. 

Focus on the bottom side of this new rectangle and switch to the **Path Selection Tool**. Select the right anchor point and remove it by  tapping the **X** button from the left side of your Titlebar. Select the other anchor point and drag it **60 px** to the right. Once again, the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will come in handy. In the end your rectangle should turn into a simple triangle as shown in the second image.

##Step 9

Make sure that your triangle is still selected and switch to the **Rotate Tool**. Focus on your triangle and you should notice a little cross icon right in the center of the selected shape, that's the reference point. Use a simple tap to move your reference point in the bottom corner of your triangle. Move to the **Tool Options** pane, set the **Angle** to **120 degrees**, and then  tap that **Copy** button twice.

##Step 12

Pick the **Path Selection Tool** and make sure that the **Add to Selection** mode is active. Select the blue shapes along with that tiny, orange circle, focus on the **Combine** pane and simply tap the **Make Compound Path** button. Make sure that your newly made compound path is selected, focus on the Toolbar and simply replace the existing **Fill** color with **R=29 G=29 B=29**.

##Step 13

 Make sure that your compound path is still selected, focus on the right side of your Titlebar and tap the leftmost icon. Move to the **Effects** pane  and simply check the box that stands for the existing **Drop Shadow** to activate it.  Enter **1** in the **Y** box and **0** in the other two boxes and then tap the color well of this **Drop Shadow**. Set the color to white and drag the **Alpha** slider to **70%**. 
 
Return to the **Effects** panel and tap the cogwheel icon of that **Drop Shadow** effect to open the context menu. Go to **Blend Mode**, select **Soft Light** from that list and then tap that **Done** button.

##Step 15

Select your yellow circle, focus on the **Effects** pane and tap the existing **Stroke**. Set the **Width** to **1 pt** and the **Alignment** to **Inside** and then   click the color well that stands for your **Stroke**. Replace the existing color with **R=180 G=135 B=5** and make sure that the **Alpha** slider is set to **100%**.

##Step 17

Using the **Rectangle Tool (M)**, create a **600 px** square and center it. Make sure that this new shape stays selected and focus on the **Effects** pane. 

Tap the color well of the existing **Fill**, and then tap the **Gradient Fill** and the **Radial** buttons from the newly opened pane. Keep focusing on the gradient, set the **Angle** to **0 degrees** and then move to the gradient sliders. Tap the left one and set its color to **R=45 G=45 B=45** and then tap the right one and set its color to **R=25 G=25 B=25**. 

Finally,  go to the **Arrange** pane and drag the **Order** slider to the left to send your  square in the back.
