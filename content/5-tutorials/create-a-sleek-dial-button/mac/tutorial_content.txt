In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a neat dial button in Graphic for Mac. 

For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid, how to create a flat background and how to easily center it. Using several circles, linear gradients and a bunch of strokes and effects you will learn how to create your own dial button. 





##Step 1

For this tutorial we'll create a new **600 x 600 pixel** document. Choose **File &gt; New (Command + N)** to bring up the **New Document** pane. Select the **Grid** document style, set the document units to **pixels**, and set the document dimensions to **600** pixels wide by **600** pixels high.

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. If the **Properties** pane is not currently visible, you can click on the  ruler icon above the **Layers** pane to show and hide the pane. Change the grid **X Spacing** and **Y Spacing** to **5**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0**, and enable **Snap to Grid (Command + Shift + ')**.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and you will notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the stroke color is set to black. 

Click on the fill color wheel and set the fill color to **R=240 G=238 B=238**. Next, click on the stroke color wheel and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**, which will simply make the stroke invisible. 

Pick the **Rectangle Tool (M)**, focus on your canvas and create a **600 px** square. Holding the **Shift** button will make it a lot easier for you to create a perfect square. Also, the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.

##Step 3

Make sure that your square is still selected, move to the **Alignment** pane from the **Properties** panel and simply click the **Horizontal Centers** and **Vertical Centers** buttons to bring your square in the center of the canvas.

##Step 4

Return to your **Toolbar**, make sure that the **Stroke** is invisible and then set the **Fill** color at **R=209 G=255 B=185**.

##Step 5

Make sure that your circle stays selected and focus on the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel. If the **Appearance** pane is not currently visible, you can click on the leftmost icon located above the **Layers** panel to show and hide this pane. 

Focus on the existing **Stroke**, drag the **Width** slider to **2 pt**, select **Inside** from the **Position** drop-down menu and **Soft Light** from the **Blend** drop-down menu and then then simply click the color wheel that stands for your **Stroke**. 

Drag the **Alpha** slider to **50%** and make sure that the color is set at black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**).

##Step 8
Return to your **Toolbar**, make sure that the **Stroke** is still invisible and don't bother changing the **Fill** color. 

Using the **Ellipse Tool (O)**, create a **160 px** circle and place it as shown in the following image. Make sure that this new circle stays selected, focus on the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel and select the existing **Fill**. 

Select **Linear Gradient** from the **Type** drop-down menu, set the **Angle** to **90 degrees** and then move to the gradient sliders. 

Select the left one and set its color at **R=156 G=156 B=153** and then select the right one and se its color at **R=246 G=246 B=243**. Simply click on the gradient bar and you will get a new gradient slider. Select it, set the color at **R=206 G=206 B=203** and drag it to the left until the **Location** tooltip shows **20%**. Add a fourth gradient slider, set its color at **R=226 G=226 B=223** and position it at **40%**.
