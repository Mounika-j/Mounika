In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a neat dial button in Graphic for iPad. 

For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid, how to create a flat background and how to easily center it. Using several circles, linear gradients and a bunch of strokes and effects you will learn how to create your own dial button. 





##Step 1

For this tutorial we'll create a new **600 x 600 pixel** document. From the **Documents Browser**, tap the plus button at the top-right corner of the **Titlebar** and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. Go to the **Canvas** panel, set the **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and make sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is enabled. The **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature ensures that all shapes which are aligned to the pixel grid will have solid, crisp strokes.

Next, you need to adjust your document's grid so switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** panel. Make that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. 

Finally, open the **Grid Settings** pane. Enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in that one **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and you will notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the line color is set to black. 

Tap the fill color wheel to open the color panel and replace the existing color with **R=240 G=238 B=238**. Next, tap  the line color wheel and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**, which will simply make the stroke invisible. Pick the **Rectangle Tool**, focus on your canvas and create a **600 px** square.

##Step 3

Make sure that your square is still selected, focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the middle icon. Focus on the **Arrange** panel and simply tap the **Align Horizontal**  and **Align Vertical**  buttons to bring your square in the center of the canvas.

##Step 4

Drag the **Alpha** slider to **50%** and make sure that the color is set at black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**).

Make sure that your circle is still selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** panel and simply check the little box that stands for the existing **Inner Glow** effect to activate it. 

Drag this effect  between your two **Strokes** and then enter the attributes shown in the following image. You can easily move  attributes inside the **Effects** panel using the button made out of  three horizontal lines that  comes with every attribute. Simply tap and hold the button which stands for the attribute that you wish to be moved and then drag it wherever you want.

##Step 8
Return to your **Toolbar**, make sure that the line is still invisible and don't bother changing the fill color.

Tap the **Gradient Fill** and the **Linear** buttons, set the **Angle** to **-90 degrees** and then move to the gradient sliders. Select the left one and set its color to **R=156 G=156 B=153** and then select the right one and se its color to **R=246 G=246 B=243**. Simply tap on the gradient bar and you will get a new gradient slider. Select it, set the color to **R=206 G=206 B=203** and drag it to the left until the **Location** tooltip shows **20%**. Add a fourth gradient slider, set its color to **R=226 G=226 B=223** and position it at **40%**.
