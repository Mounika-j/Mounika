In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a neat dial button in Graphic for iPhone. 

For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid, how to create a flat background and how to easily center it. Using several circles, linear gradients and a bunch of strokes and effects you will learn how to create your own dial button. 





##Step 1

Start by tapping the   plus button from the top-left corner of your screen to create a new document. Tap the **Create Document** button and then choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar**, tap that ruler icon to open the **Properties** panel and then tap the **Canvas** pane. Set both **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and be sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is enabled. This feature ensures that all shapes that are aligned to the pixel grid will have solid, crisp strokes.

Re-open the **Properties** panel and this time tap the **Grid** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open the **Grid Settings** pane and enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and you will notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the line color is set to black. 

Tap the fill color wheel to open the color panel and replace the existing color with **R=240 G=238 B=238**. Next, tap  the line color wheel and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**, which will simply make the stroke invisible. Pick the **Rectangle Tool**, focus on your canvas and create a **600 px** square.

##Step 3

Make sure that your square is still selected, re-open the **Properties** panel using that same ruler icon and open the **Align** pane. Simply tap the  **Horizontal**  and **Vertical**  buttons to bring your square in the center of the canvas.
