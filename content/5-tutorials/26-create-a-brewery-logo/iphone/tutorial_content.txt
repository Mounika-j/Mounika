In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a brewery logo in Picta Graphic for iPhone. 

For starters, you will learn how to set up a simple grid, how to create several basic shapes and how to easily place them in the center of your canvas. Using the Layers panel, you will learn how to cleverly organise your vector shapes.

Moving on, you will learn how to add text on a path and how to easily adjust it. Finally, you will learn how to add some subtle shading and highlights using the Effects pane.
