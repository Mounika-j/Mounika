In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a brewery logo in Picta Graphic for iPad. 

For starters, you will learn how to set up a simple grid, how to create several basic shapes and how to easily place them in the center of your canvas. Using the Layers panel, you will learn how to cleverly organise your vector shapes.

Moving on, you will learn how to add text on a path and how to easily adjust it. Finally, you will learn how to add some subtle shading and highlights using the Effects pane. 



##Step 1

For this tutorial you will need to import the [**Montserrat font**](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/montserrat). Download this font and save it inside your Dropbox folder or iCloud Drive. 

Open Graphic and focus on the **Titlebar** . Tap the **Import** button and pick Dropbox or iCloud. Locate your font and select it, and then simply tap the **Import** button.

Next, you need to set up the document grid. Tap again that **Settings** icon and switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** pane. 

Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open that **Grid Settings** pane, enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and tap the **Stroke** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** which will simply make your stroke invisible. Tap the **Fill** color well and replace the existing color with **R=254 G=184 B=0**. 
Pick the **Ellipse Tool** , focus on your canvas and create a **390 px** circle. Tap and drag, and then tap and hold with a second finger to easily create a circle.
