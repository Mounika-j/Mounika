In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a brewery logo in Picta Graphic for Mac. 

For starters, you will learn how to set up a simple grid, how to create several basic shapes and how to easily place them in the center of your canvas. Using the Layers panel, you will learn how to cleverly organise your vector shapes.

Moving on, you will learn how to add text on a path and how to easily adjust it. Finally, you will learn how to add some subtle shading and highlights using the Effects pane. 



##Step 1

For this tutorial we'll create a **680 x 680 px** document. Go to **File &gt; New (Command + N)**to bring up the **New Document** panel. Select the **Grid** document style and set the document units to **pixels**. Set the document dimensions to **680** pixels wide by **680** pixels high and then click **Choose** to create your document. 

Next, we'll adjust the document grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. You can easily open or close the **Properties** panel using that ruler icon. Change the **X** &amp; **Y Spacing** to **5**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0** and don't forget to enable **Snap to Grid**—all these features will make your work easier.

Keep in mind that you can quickly enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature using the  **Command + '** and the  **Command + Shift + '** keyboard shortcuts.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and click the **Stroke** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** which will simply make your stroke invisible. Click the **Fill** color well and replace the existing color with **R=254 G=184 B=0**. 

Pick the **Ellipse Tool (O)**, focus on your canvas and create a **390 px** circle. Holding the **Shift** key will make it a lot easier for you to create a perfect circle.
