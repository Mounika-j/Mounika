In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a flat download button in  Graphic for iPhone. 

For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create the  cloud shape using basic tools and vector shape building techniques. Next, you'll learn how to create the main button shape and how to add subtle shading and highlights for your objects. 

Finally, you will learn how to create a simple piece of text and how to stylize it. 





##Step 1

Start by tapping the   plus button from the top-left corner of your screen to create a new document. Tap the **Create Document** button and then choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar**, tap that ruler icon to open the **Properties** panel and then tap the **Canvas** pane. Set both **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and be disabled.

Re-open the **Properties** panel and this time open sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is the **Grid** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open the **Grid Settings** pane and enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and   notice that by default the **Fill** color is set to white while the **Line** color is set to black. Tap the **Fill** color well and set its color to **R=255 G=215 B=0** and then tap the **Line** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this  will simply make your line invisible. 

Pick the **Ellipse  Tool** and create a **30 px** shape - the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.
