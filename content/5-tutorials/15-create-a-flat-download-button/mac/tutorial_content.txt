In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a flat download button in  Graphic for Mac. 

For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create the  cloud shape using basic tools and vector shape building techniques. Next, you'll learn how to create the main button shape and how to add subtle shading and highlights for your objects. 

Finally, you will learn how to create a simple piece of text and how to stylize it. 





##Step 1

Go to **File &gt; New (Command + N)** to bring up the **New Document** window. Select the **Grid** document style, set the document units to **pixels**, and set the document dimensions to **600** pixels wide by **600** pixels high.

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. If the **Properties** panel is not currently visible, you can easily open it using the ruler icon that lies above the **Layers** panel. Change the grid **X Spacing** and **Y Spacing** to **5**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0** and enable **Snap to Grid (Command + Shift + ')**.

Keep in mind that you can quickly enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature using the  **Command +  '** and  **Command + Shift + '** keyboard shortcuts.

##Step 2

Focus on the Toolbar and  notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the stroke color is set to black. Click  the **Fill** color well and set it to **R=255 G=200 B=0** and then click the **Stroke** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this will simply make your stroke invisible. 

Pick the **Ellipse  Tool (O)** and create a **30 px** circle - the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.

##Step 3

Set the **Fill** color to **R=238 G=102 B=0** and make sure that the **Ellipse Tool (O)** is still active. Create a second, **30 px** circle and place it exactly as shown in the following image.

##Step 8
For the following steps you will need a grid every **1 px**. This simply means that you need to return to the **Grid**  pane of your **Properties** panel and enter **1 px** in the **X** and **Y Spacing** boxes. You will also need the **Appearance** panel which can  be easily opened by clicking the leftmost icon that lies above the **Layers** panel. 

Return to your **Toolbar**, remove the color from the **Fill** and then select the **Stroke** and set its color to **R=0 G=125 B=215**. Pick the **Rectangle Tool (M)** and create a **12 x 8 px** shape. Make sure that this new rectangle stays selected and focus on the **Stroke** pane from the **Appearance** panel. Set the **Line Weight** to **1 pt** and the **Position** to **Outside** and then  check that **Round Join** button. In the end your blue path should look like in the following image.
