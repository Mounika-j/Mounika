In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a flat download button in  Graphic for iPad.
 
For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create the  cloud shape using basic tools and vector shape building techniques. Next, you'll learn how to create the main button shape and how to add subtle shading and highlights for your objects. 

Finally, you will learn how to create a simple piece of text and how to stylize it. 





##Step 1

From the **Documents Browser**, tap the plus button at the top-left corner of the **Titlebar** and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. Go to the **Canvas** pane, set the **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and make sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled.

Next, you need to set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open that **Grid Settings** pane, enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and   notice that by default the **Fill** color is set to white while the **Line** color is set to black. Tap the **Fill** color well and set its color to **R=255 G=215 B=0** and then tap the **Line** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this  will simply make your line invisible. 

Pick the **Ellipse  Tool** and  create a **30 px** circle - the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.
