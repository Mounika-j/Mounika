In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a pretty simple calendar widget in Graphic for iPad. 

For starters you will learn how to create a new document and how to set up a simple grid. Using the Rounded Rectangle Tool  and the Rotate Tool, you will learn how to create the main shapes. Taking full advantage of the Effects pane, you will learn how to add shading and sleek highlights for your shapes. 

Moving on, you will learn  some neat stroke tricks and how to ease your work using the Copy/Paste Style feature. Finally, you will learn how to add and stylize text in  Graphic. 



##Step 1

From the **Documents Browser**, tap the plus button at the top-left corner of the **Titlebar** and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. In the **Canvas** pane set the **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base units, and verify that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled. When this setting is enabled, stroked objects are offset slightly to ensure that the stroke is drawn aligned to the pixel grid which guarantees a crisp look.

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** pane in the **Settings** popover. Ensure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or **Snap to Grid**. Finally, simply tap the **Grid Spacing** pane, enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar**, tap the **Fill** color well and set its color to **R=2 G=53 B=83**, and then tap the **Line** color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**. This  will simply make your line invisible.

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, focus on the newly opened **Tool Options** pane and  drag that  **Radius** slider to **10**. Move to your canvas and create a **220 x 225 px** shape.

##Step 3

Make sure that the **Rounded Rectangle Tool** is still active, return to that **Tool Options** pane and drag the  **Radius** slider to **5**. 

Move to your canvas, create a **50 x 50 px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the following images — the  grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature should ease your work.

##Step 4

Using that same **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, create a **40 x 40 px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the first image (the color attributes are not very important).  

Pick the **Path Selection Tool**, focus on the newly opened **Tool Options** pane and activate the **Add to Selection** mode which will allow you to easily select more that one shape using simple taps.

Select the shape made in this step along with the one made in the previous step, focus on right side of your **Titlebar** and tap that rectangular icon. Move to the **Combine** pane and  tap the **Subtract** command. In the end your new shape should look like in the second image.

##Step 5

Make sure that the shape made in the previous step is still selected and pick the **Rotate Tool**. Focus on the newly opened **Tool Options** pane, set the **Angle** to **45 degrees** and  tap the **Rotate** button. In the end things should look like in the second image.

##Step 7

Make sure that your shape stays selected, focus on the right side of your **Titlebar** and  tap the leftmost icon to open that menu. Go to the **Effects** pane and tap the existing **Stroke** to expand it. 

Be sure that  the **Width** slider is set to **1 pt**, select the **Inside Alignment** button, and then  tap  the color well of this **Stroke**. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **100%** and replace the existing color with **R=2 G=43 B=67**.

##Step 8

Make sure that your shape is still selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** pane and add a second **Stroke** using that plus button located in the bottom, right corner of your pane. 

Select this new **Stroke** and  simply enter the attributes shown in the following image.

##Step 9

Make sure that your shape is still selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** pane and simply check the round checkbox of the existing **Inner Shadow** effect to activate it. Tap its right side handle to easily drag it right below the **Fill** and then expand it. 

Enter **0 pt** in the **X Offset**  box and **2 pt** in the **Y Offset**  box, drag the **Blur** slider to **0**, and then tap the color well of this effect. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **30%** and replace the existing color with white (**R=255 G=255 B=255**). Return to the **Effects** pane and tap the cogwheel button of this same effect. Tap the **Blend Mode** command, select  **Soft Light** from that list, and then tap that **Done** button. In the end things should look like in the following image.

##Step 10

Make sure that your shape is still selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** pane and add a second **Inner Shadow** effect using that same plus button.

Pick the **Pen Tool** or the **Line Tool**, create an **150 px**, vertical path and place it exactly as shown in the first image. Make sure that this black path stays selected. First, go to the **Effects** pane, select the existing **Stroke** and drag that **Width** slider to **2 pt**. 

Move to the left side of your **Titlebar** and tap that paperclip icon to open the **Edit** pane. Use the **Copy** and **Paste** commands to multiply your black path.

With this new path still selected, add three copies using the same **Copy** and **Paste** commands from that **Edit** pane. Spreat the copies as shown in the second image making sure that there's a **30 px** gap between each path.

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, make sure that the  **Radius** is set to **5** and  get back to your canvas. Create a **210 x 90 px** shape and place it as shown in the first image. 

Switch to the **Rectangle Tool**, create a **210 x 30 px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the second image.

##Step 33


Get back to your **Toolbar**,  make the **Fill** invisible and change  **Stroke** color to white. You will also need a grid every **1 px**. This simply means that you have to return to the **Grid and Rulers** pane,  tap the **Grid Spacing** pane and enter **1 px** in both **Spacing** boxes.  

Pick the **Pen Tool** or the **Line Tool** and focus on the top, left corner of your blue shape. Create an **8 px**, vertical path and place it roughly as shown in the following image. Make sure that this path stays selected and focus on **Stroke** from the **Effects** pane. Drag the  **Width** slider to **2 pt** and then check the **Round Cap** and the **Round Join** buttons.

##Step 34

Make sure that your vertical, white path stays selected and reselect the **Pen Tool**. Focus on the **Tool Options** pane and activate the **Add Point** mode. Move to your selection and simply tap in the middle to add a new anchor point. 

Switch to the **Path Selection Tool**, select that new anchor point and  drag it **4 px** to the left. In the end things should look like in the second image.

##Step 36

Make sure that your white path stays selected and pick the **Rotate Tool**. Focus on the **Tool Options** pane, set the **Angle** to **180 degrees**, and then  tap that **Copy** button. This will create a horizontally flipped copy of your white path. Select this new path, drag it to the right and try   to place it roughly as shown in the third image.

##Step 37

Pick  the **Text Tool** and   double tap inside that new field. Set the color to white, select the **Arial Rounded MT** font and make it **Bold**. Set the **Size**  to **10** and then  add the  &quot;_October_&quot; piece of text. 

Place it as shown in the following image, make sure that it stays selected and go to the **Effect** pane. Activate the existing **Drop Shadow** effect and enter the attributes shown in the following image.

##Step 38

Using  the **Type Tool (T)**, add the &quot;_Mo_&quot; piece of text and place it about as shown in the following image.
 
Select  your &quot;_October_&quot; piece of text, open that **Edit** pane and tap the **Copy Style** command. Reselect your &quot;_Mo_&quot; piece of text, reopen the Edit pane and tap the **Paste Style** command. This basically applies the **Effects** attributes of the &quot;_October_&quot; piece of text to the &quot;_Mo_&quot; piece of text.

Use the same tools and techniques to add the other six short day names.
