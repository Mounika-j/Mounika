In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a pretty simple calendar widget in Graphic in Mac. 

For starters you will learn how to create a new document and how to set up a simple grid. Using the Rounded Rectangle Tool  and the Rotate Tool, you will learn how to create the main shapes. Taking full advantage of the Effects pane, you will learn how to add shading and sleek highlights for your shapes. 

Moving on, you will learn  some neat stroke tricks and how to ease your work with scripts. Finally, you will learn how to add and stylize text in  Graphic. 





##Step 1

Go to **File &gt; New (Command + N)** to bring up the **New Document** panel. Select the **Grid** document style, set the document units to **pixels**, and set the document dimensions to **600 x 600 pixels**.

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. If the **Properties** panel is not currently visible, you can click on that  ruler icon. Change the grid **X Spacing** and **Y Spacing** to **5 px**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0 px**, and enable **Snap to Grid (Command + Shift + ')**.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar**, click on the **Fill** color well and set the  color to **R=2 G=53 B=83**. Next, click on the **Stroke** color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**, this will simply make the stroke invisible. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)**, focus on the **Tool Options** bar and  drag that **Corner Radius** slider to **10 pt**. Move to your canvas and create a **220 x 225 px** shape.

##Step 3

Make sure that the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)** is still active, return to your **Tool Options** bar and drag the **Corner Radius** slider to **5 pt**. 

Move to your canvas, create a **50 x 50 px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the following image. The grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature should ease your work.

##Step 4

Using that same **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)**, create a **40 x 40 px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the first image (the color attributes are not very important).

 Using the **Move Tool (V)** and the **Shift** key, select the shape made in this step along with the one made in the previous step. Focus on the **Path Tools** pane from the **Properties** panel and simply click that **Subtract** command. In the end your new shape should look like in the second image.

Pick the **Pen Tool (P)** or the **Line Tool (L)** and focus on the top, left corner of your blue shape. Create an **8 px**, vertical path and place it roughly as shown in the following image. Make sure that this path stays selected and move to the **Stroke** pane from the **Appearance** panel.

Also change the text color to white and then click on your canvas. Add the &quot;_October_&quot; piece of text and place it as shown in the following image.

##Step 38

Using  the **Type Tool (T)**, add the &quot;_Mo_&quot; piece of text and place it about as shown in the following image. 

Select  your &quot;_October_&quot; piece of text, right click anywhere on your canvas (or **Control + Click**) and go to **Copy Style**. Reselect your &quot;_Mo_&quot; piece of text, right click again and this time go to **Paste Style**. This basically swaps the **Effects** attributes from the &quot;_October_&quot; piece of text to the &quot;_Mo_&quot; piece of text.
