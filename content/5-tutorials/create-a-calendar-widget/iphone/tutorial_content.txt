In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a pretty simple calendar widget in Graphic for iPhone. 

For starters you will learn how to create a new document and how to setup a simple grid. Using the Rounded Rectangle Tool  and the Rotate Tool, you will learn how to create the main shapes. Taking full advantage of the Effects pane, you will learn how to add shading and sleek highlights for your shapes. 

Moving on, you will learn  some neat stroke tricks and how to ease your work using the Copy/Paste Style feature. Finally, you will learn how to add and stylize text in  Graphic. 






##Step 1

Start by tapping the   plus button from the top-left corner of your screen to create a new document. Tap the **Create Document** button and then choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar**, tap that ruler icon to open the **Properties** panel and then tap the **Canvas** pane. Set both **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and be sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled. When this setting is enabled, stroked objects are offset slightly to ensure that the stroke is drawn aligned to the pixel grid which guarantees a crisp look.

Re-open the **Properties** panel and this time tap the **Grid** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open the **Grid Settings** pane and enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar**, tap the **Fill** color well and set its color to **R=2 G=53 B=83**, and then tap the **Line** color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**. This  will simply make your line invisible.

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, focus on the newly opened **Tool Options** pane and  drag that  **Radius** slider to **10**. Move to your canvas and create a **220 x 225 px** shape.

##Step 3

Make sure that the **Rounded Rectangle Tool** is still active, return to that **Tool Options** pane and drag the  **Radius** slider to **5**. 

Move to your canvas, create a **50 x 50 px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the following images — the  grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature should ease your work.

##Step 4

Using that same **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, create a **40 x 40 px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the first image (the color attributes are not very important). 

Pick the **Path Selection Tool**, focus on the newly opened **Tool Options** pane and activate the **Add to Selection** mode which will allow you to easily select more that one shape using simple taps.

Select the shape made in this step along with the one made in the previous step, open the **Combine** pane from the **Properties** panel and  tap that **Subtract** command. In the end your new shape should look like in the second image.

Be sure that  the **Width** slider is set to **1 pt**, select the **Inside Alignment** button, and then  tap  the color well of this **Stroke**. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **100%** and replace the existing color with **R=2 G=43 B=67**.

##Step 9

Make sure that your shape is still selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** pane and simply check the round checkbox of the existing **Inner Shadow** effect to activate it. Tap its right side handle to easily drag it right below the **Fill** and then expand it. 

Enter **0 pt** in the **X Offset**  box and **2 pt** in the **Y Offset**  box, drag the **Blur** slider to **0**, and then tap the color well of this effect. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **30%** and replace the existing color with  white (**R=255 G=255 B=255**). Return to the **Effects** pane and tap the cogwheel button of this same effect. Tap the **Blend Mode** command and select **Soft Light** from that list. In the end things should look like in the following image.

##Step 10

##Step 21

Using the **Pen Tool** or the **Line Tool**, create a **210 px**, horizontal path and place it exactly as shown in the first image.

Pick the **Pen Tool** or the **Line Tool** and focus on the top, left corner of your blue shape. Create an **8 px**, vertical path and place it roughly as shown in the following image. Make sure that this path stays selected and focus on **Stroke** from the **Effects** pane. Drag the  **Width** slider to **2 pt** and then check the **Round Cap** and the **Round Join** buttons.

Switch to the **Path Selection Tool**, select that new anchor point and  drag it **4 px** to the left. In the end things should look like in the second image.

##Step 36

Make sure that your white path stays selected and pick the **Rotate Tool**. Focus on the **Tool Options** pane, set the **Angle** to **180 degrees**, and then  tap that **Copy** button. This will create a horizontally flipped copy of your white path. Select this new path, drag it to the right and try   to place it roughly as shown in the third image. 

(image: calendarWidgetiPhone36.jpg)



##Step 37

Set the **Fill** color to white, pick  the **Text Tool** and simply  double tap inside that new field. Select the **Arial Rounded MT**  font and make it **Bold**. Set the   **Size** slider to **10** and then simply type the  &quot;_October_&quot; piece of text. Place it as shown in the following image.

##Step 38

Using  the **Type Tool**, add the &quot;_Mo_&quot; piece of text and place it about as shown in the following image.
 
Select  your &quot;_October_&quot; piece of text, open the **Appearance**  panel and tap the **Copy Style** command. Reselect that &quot;_Mo_&quot; piece of text and tap the **Paste Style** command from the **Appearance** panel. This basically applies the **Effects** attributes of the &quot;_October_&quot; piece of text to the &quot;_Mo_&quot; piece of text.
