In the following tutorial you will learn how to create an envelope icon in Graphic for iPad. 

In the beginning you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create the main shapes using the Rounded Rectangle Tool. Using blending and vector shape building techniques you will learn how to create the rest of the shapes and how to add some subtle highlights and shading. 

Finally, you will learn how to create a flat background and how to easily center it. 





##Step 1

For this tutorial we'll create a new **600 x 600 pixel** document. From the **Documents Browser**, tap the plus button at the top-right corner of the **Titlebar** and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. Go to the **Canvas** panel, set the **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and make sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is enabled. The **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature ensures that all shapes which are aligned to the pixel grid will have solid, crisp strokes.

Next, you need to adjust your document's grid so switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** panel. Make that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Open the **Grid Settings** pane, enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in that one **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and you will notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the line color is set to black. 

Tap the fill color wheel and replace the existing color with **R=255 G=185 B=0**. Next, tap  the line color wheel and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**, which will simply make the line invisible. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, focus on the newly opened tool pane and drag the  **Radius** slider to **5**. Move to your canvas and create a **180 x 115 px** shape.

##Step 3

Return to your **Toolbar**, this time make sure that the fill  is invisible and then set the line color to black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**). 

Pick the **Rectangle Tool**, create a **180 x 75 px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the following image. 

Make sure that this rectangle stays selected, focus on the right side of your **Titlebar** and tap the leftmost icon. Move to the **Effects** pane, focus on the existing **Stroke** and simply tap the **Outside** Alignment button.

##Step 4

Focus on the top side of your rectangle and pick the **Path Selection Tool**. First, select the left anchor point and drag it **90 px** to the right and then select the right anchor point and remove it using the **X** button from the left side of your **Titlebar**. 

In the end your rectangle should turn into a simple triangle as shown in the second image. Select it, focus on the right side of your **Titlebar** and tap the middle icon. Move to the **Path** panel and simply tap the **Outline Stroke** button.

##Step 5

Reselect  your yellow shape, focus on the left side of your **Titlebar** and tap that paperclip icon to open the popover menu. Tap the **Copy** and **Paste in Place** buttons to easily make a copy in front.
 
Pick the **Path Selection Tool**, focus on the newly opened tool pane and activate the second tool mode. Select the copy made in this step along with the black shape, open the **Combine** **** panel and tap the **Intersect** button. 

Make sure that the resulting shape stays selected and move to the **Effects** panel. Focus on the existing **Fill**, tap the **Gradient Fill** and **Linear** buttons, set the **Angle** to **-90 degrees** and then move to the gradient slider. Select the left one, drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and replace the existing color with **R=250 G=250 B=250** and  then select the right slider, drag the **Alpha** slider to **10%** and make sure that the color is set to black.
