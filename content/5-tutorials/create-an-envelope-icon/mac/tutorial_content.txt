In the following tutorial you will learn how to create an envelope icon in Graphic for Mac. 

In the beginning you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create the main shapes using the Rounded Rectangle Tool. Using blending modes and vector shape building techniques you will learn how to create the rest of the shapes and how to add some subtle highlights and shading. 

Finally, you will learn how to create a flat background and how to easily center it. 





##Step 1

For this tutorial we'll create a new **600 x 600 pixel** document. Go to **File &gt; New** or hit the **Command + N** keyboard shortcut to bring up the **New Document** window. Select the **Grid** document style, select **pixels** for the document unit and then set the document dimensions to **600** pixels wide by **600** pixels high.

Next, you need to adjust  the document's grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. If the **Properties** pane is not currently visible, you can easily open it using the ruler icon that lies above the **Layers** panel. Change the grid **X Spacing** and **Y Spacing** to **5**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0** and then enable **Snap to Grid**. 

Keep in mind that you can quickly enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature using the  **Command +  '** and  **Command + Shift + '** keyboard shortcuts.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and you will notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the stroke color is set to black. 

Click the fill color wheel to open the color panel and replace the existing color with **R=255 G=185 B=0**. Next, click  the stroke color wheel and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**, which will simply make your stroke invisible. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)**, focus on the tool options bar and drag the **Corner Radius** slider to **5 pt**. Move to your canvas and create a **180 x 115 px** shape.

##Step 3

Return to your **Toolbar**, this time make sure that the fill  is invisible and  set the stroke color to black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**).
 
Pick the **Rectangle Tool (M)**, create an **180 x 75 px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the following image. Make sure that this rectangle stays selected and go to the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel. If the **Appearance** pane is not currently visible, you can click the lefmost icon that lies above the **Layers** pane to open it. 

Select  the existing **Stroke** and simply select **Outside** from that **Position** drop-down menu.

##Step 4

Focus on the top side of your rectangle and pick the **Path Selection Tool (A)**.
 
First, select the left anchor point and drag it **90 px** to the right and then select the right anchor point and get rid of it using the **Delete** button from your keyboard. In the end your rectangle should turn into a simple triangle as shown in the second image. 

Select it, focus on the **Path Tools** pane from the **Properties** panel and click the **Outline Stroke** button.

##Step 5

Reselect  your yellow shape and make a copy in front using the **Command + C &gt; Command + Shift + V** keyboard shortcut. 

Select this fresh copy along with the black shape, focus on the **Path Tools** pane from the **Properties** panel and click the **Intersect** button. Make sure that the resulting shape stays selected and move to the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel. 

Focus on the existing **Fill**, select **Linear Gradient** from the **Type** drop-down menu, set the **Angle** to **90 degrees** and then move to the gradient slider. Select the left one, drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and replace the existing color with **R=250 G=250 B=250** and  then select the right slider, drag the **Alpha** slider at **10%** and make sure that the color is set to black.
