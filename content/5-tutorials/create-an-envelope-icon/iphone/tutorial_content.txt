In the following tutorial you will learn how to create an envelope icon in Graphic for iPhone. 

In the beginning you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create the main shapes using the Rounded Rectangle Tool. Using blending and vector shape building techniques you will learn how to create the rest of the shapes and how to add some subtle highlights and shading. 

Finally, you will learn how to create a flat background and how to easily center it. 





##Step 1

Start by tapping the   plus button from the top-left corner of your screen to create a new document. Tap the **Create Document** button and then choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar**, tap that ruler icon to open the **Properties** panel and then tap the **Canvas** pane. Set both **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and be sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is enabled. This feature ensures that all shapes that are aligned to the pixel grid will have solid, crisp strokes.

Re-open the **Properties** panel and this time tap the **Grid** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open the **Grid Settings** pane and enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and you will notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the line color is set to black. 

Tap the fill color wheel and replace the existing color with **R=255 G=185 B=0** and  tap  the line color wheel and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**, which will simply make the line invisible. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, focus on the newly opened tool pane and drag the  **Radius** slider to **5**. Move to your canvas and create a **180 x 115 px** shape.
