In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a simple floor plan design in Graphic. For starters you will learn how to customize the grid and create a set of simple shapes using basic vector shape building techniques.

Using the Pen Tool, you'll create wall outlines and learn how to work with multiple layers. Moving on, you will learn how to add various types of labels and easily transfer them from one object to another. 

Taking full advantage of the Effects pane, you will learn how to add multiple strokes to a single shape and how to save and reuse styles. You'll also learn how to create arrowed, dashed and dimension lines and how to quickly edit them. 

Finally, you'll learn how to place text on a path and export your design with the grid and canvas background.


##Step 1

For this tutorial we'll create a new **63 x 63 feet** document. Go to **File &gt; New** or hit the **Command + N** keyboard shortcut to bring up the **New Document** window. Select the **Grid** document style, select **inches** for the document unit and then set the document dimensions to **63** inches wide by **63** inches high.

We're about to create a ‘to-scale’ technical design using the canvas scale settings. Simply open the **Canvas** pane from the **Properties** panel and change the scale unit from inches to feet. The actual paper size of the document will not change, only the displayed values and units are adjusted by this setting.  If the **Properties** pane is not currently visible, you can easily open it using the ruler icon that lies above the **Layers** panel. 

Next, you need to adjust  the document's grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. Change the grid **X Spacing** and **Y Spacing** to **0.5 ft**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0** and then enable **Snap to Grid** feature. 

Keep in mind that you can quickly enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature using the  **Command +  '** and  **Command + Shift + '** keyboard shortcuts.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and you will notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the stroke color is set to black. Click  the fill color well and replace the existing color with **R=0 G=164 B=255** and then click the stroke color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**, which will simply make the stroke invisible. 

 Pick the **Rectangle Tool (M)**, focus on your canvas and create a **13 x 12.5 ft** shape - the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work. Make sure that this blue rectangles stays selected and go to the **Geometry** pane from the **Properties** panel. Focus on the **Position** attributes and simply enter the numbers mentioned in the following image to easily place your selected shape in the desired location.

##Step 3

Using the **Rectangle Tool (M)**, create the series of rectangles shown in the following image and use the size attributes indicated below. Try to use somewhat similar fill colors, but don't struggle to get the exact tint. 

(image: floorPlan3.jpg)



##Step 4

Using the **Rectangle Tool (M)**, create a **13 x 14.5 ft** shape, fill it with a random yellow and place it as shown in the first image. 

Pick the **Pen Tool (P)**, move to the tool options bar  and activate the **Add Point mode**. Focus on the bottom, left corner of your yellow rectangle and use the click button to quickly add two anchors points as shown in the first image. 
Switch to the **Path Selection Tool (A)**, select the bottom, left anchor point and simply drag it **2.5 ft** up and **2.5 ft** to the right. In the end the shape made in this step should look like in the second image. 

(image: floorPlan4.jpg)



##Step 5

Using the **Rectangle Tool (M)**, create a **26 x 14.5 ft** shape, fill it with a random blue and place it as shown in the first image. Using the same tool, create a **6 x 3 ft** shape, and place it as shown in the second image. 

Switch to the **Move Tool (V)**, select both shapes made in this step, open the **Path Tools** pane from the **Properties** panel and click the **Subtract** button. In the end your blue shape should look like in the fourth image.

(image: floorPlan5.jpg)



##Step 6

Using the **Rectangle Tool (M)**, create a **6 x 16 ft** shape, fill it with white and place it as shown in the first image. Create second, white rectangles, make it **15 ft** wide and **4 ft** tall and then place it as shown in the second image. 

Switch to the **Move Tool (M)**, select both shapes made in this step and click the **Union** button **Path Tools** pane. Hold the **Shift** key to easily select several shapes from your canvas by clicking them.

##Step 7

Focus on the **Layers** panel. First, double click the existing layer and rename it &quot;_rooms_&quot;. Next, use the plus button located in the bottom, left corner of your panel to add a  second layer. Make  sure that this new layer stays selected, as the new objects you are about to create  will go here. Also, rename this new layer &quot;_walls_&quot;. If  needed, simply click and drag the layers to change their order. 

Move to your **Toolbar**, make the fill invisible and then click the stroke color well, replace the existing color with **R=169 G=217 B=237** and make sure that the **Alpha** slider is set to **100%**. Pick the **Pen Tool (P)** and create the two paths that go around your existing set of shapes as shown in the following image. That bottom, **2.5 ft** gap between the paths will be the entry door.

Make sure that your two paths remain selected, open the **Stroke** pane from the **Appearance** panel and simply drag that **Line Weight** to **60 pt**. If the **Appearance** pane is not currently visible, you can click  the leftmost icon that lies above the **Layers** pane to show and hide this panel. In the end your two, blue paths should look like in the following image. 
You're going to use that light blue color numerous times throughout the tutorial. To ease your work you should save this particular color inside your **Color Palette**. Return to the **Toolbar** and  click again the stroke color well. Switch from the **Color Picker** to the **Color Palette** and click that plus button to  save the active color.

##Step 8
Using that same **Pen Tool (P)**, create the straight paths that will make up the interior walls. Add a **20 pt** stroke for these paths and use your saved, light blue color from the **Color Palette**. Remember to leave a **2.5 ft** gap for each door.

##Step 9

Return to the **Layers** panel and select the &quot;_room_&quot; layer as we are about to edit the shapes that lie inside this layer. 

Start with the top, left one. Select it and focus on the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel. Simply click the color well that stands for the existing **Fill**, replace the existing color with **R=2 G=33 B=51** and drag the **Alpha** slider to **50%**. 

(image: floorPlan9.jpg)



##Step 10

Make sure that the top, left rectangle is still selected and move to the **Label** pane from the **Appearance** panel. First, select the **Dimension** label and then check the **Area** button which will automatically add a label that points the area of your selected object. Center this label using the **Align Centered** button or use the **Location** and **Offset** sliders to position your label in a different spot. 

With your shape still selected, move to the **Text** pane from the **Appearance** panel to adjust that label's text attributes. First, select the [**Ubuntu Mono font**](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/ubuntu), make it **Bold** and set the size to **100 pt**. Click the **Label** color well and replace the existing color with **R=255 G=180 B=0**. Again, you'll need this yellow plenty of times throughout the tutorial so make sure that you're saving it inside the **Color Palette**. Return to the **Text** pane, make sure that there's no color set for the border and skip the other attributes. 

(image: floorPlan10.jpg)



##Step 11

Make sure that your labeled rectangle is still selected, right click anywhere on your canvas and go to **Copy Style**. Select the yellow, blue, purple and red shapes, right click again and this time go to **Paste Style**. 

(image: floorPlan11.jpg)



##Step 12

Select the white shape and focus on the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel. Click the **Fill** color well, replace the existing color with **R=2 G=33 B=51** and drag the **Alpha** slider to **50%**. 

(image: floorPlan12.jpg)



##Step 13

Select the two, orange shapes and focus on that same **Effects** pane. We’re going to assign a slightly darker color to these two rectangles: **R=0 G=23 B=41**. Don't forget to drag the **Alpha** slider to **50%**.

(image: floorPlan13.jpg)



##Step 14

Keep focusing on the two rectangles edited in the previous step. First, select the left one and go to the **Label** pane from the **Appearance** panel. This time set the **Label** to **Text** which will allow you to add any piece of text as a label. For this shape use the &quot;_CLOSET_&quot; text and then enter the rest of the attributes indicated in the following image. Don't forget to also move to the **Text** pane and adjust the properties as shown below. 

Move to right rectangle and add a similar **Text Label**. This time add the &quot;_WARDROBE_&quot; piece of text  and then enter all the attributes shown in the following image. 

(image: floorPlan14.jpg)



##Step 15

Return to the **Layers** panel and add a new layer using that same plus button. Select this new layer, rename it &quot;_windows_&quot; and drag in the the top of the panel. 

Using the **Line Tool (L)**, create a **4 ft**, vertical path and place it roughly as shown in the following image. Make sure that this new path stays selected, focus on the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel and select the existing **Stroke**. Drag that **Width** slider to **60 pt** and then click the color well that stands for this stroke and pick a random red. 

(image: floorPlan15.jpg)



##Step 16

Use that same **Line Tool (L)** to add a bunch of new, straight lines roughly as shown in the following image. 

(image: floorPlan16.jpg)



##Step 17

Focus on one of your red lines and select it. Go to the **Effects** pane and add a second stroke using the plus button located in the bottom, left corner of the pane. 

Select this new stroke and for starters make sure that it lies below the other stroke. Keep in mind that you can easily click and drag attributes inside the **Effects** pane. Drag the **Width** slider to **40 pt** and then click the color well that stands for this new stroke. Make sure that the **Alpha** slider is set to **100%** and then replace the existing color with **R=2 G=33 B=51**. You'll need again this dark blue color so don't forget to quickly save it. 

(image: floorPlan17.jpg)



##Step 18

Make sure that the red line edited in the previous step is still selected and keep focusing on the **Effects** pane. Add a new **Stroke** using that same plus button and make sure that it goes below the existing strokes. Focus on this new stroke, set the **Width** to **10 pt** and for the color add your light blue from the **Color Palette**. 

(image: floorPlan18.jpg)



##Step 19

Make sure that the red line edited in the previous step is still selected and keep focusing on the **Effects** pane. Click the color well that stands for the red stroke and simply replace that red with your light blue from the **Color Palette**. 

(image: floorPlan19.jpg)



##Step 20

Make sure that the  line edited in the previous step is still selected and go to **Styles** panel. If the **Styles** panel is not currently visible, you can click  the paint roller icon located above the **Layers** pane to show and hide this panel. Simply click the plus button that lies in the bottom, left corner of the **Styles** panel to save  the style of your selected, straight line. 

(image: floorPlan20.jpg)



##Step 21

Select the remaining red lines and simply click your style from the **Styles** panel. 

(image: floorPlan21.jpg)



##Step 22

Using the **Line Tool (L)**, create a **6 ft**, horizontal path and two, **2.5 ft**, vertical paths and then place them as shown in the following image. Add a **20 pt** stroke for these new paths and pick a random red for the stroke color. 
(image: floorPlan22.jpg)



##Step 23


Make sure that the three lines made in the previous step are still selected and keep focusing on the **Effects** pane. First, select the existing stroke and replace that red with your light blue from the **Color Palette**. Next, add a second stroke and drag it below the existing one. Set the **Width** for this new stroke to **8 pt** and replace the existing color with your dark blue from the **Color Palette**. 

(image: floorPlan23.jpg)



##Step 24

Using the **Line Tool (L)**, create an **11 ft**, vertical path and place it as shown in the following image. Add a **40 pt** stroke for this path and for the color use your light blue from the **Color Palette**. Make sure that this new path stays selected and keep focusing on the **Effects** pane. Add a second stroke, drag it below the existing one, set the **Width** to **20 pt** and for the color use your dark blue from the **Color Palette**. 

(image: floorPlan24.jpg)



##Step 25

Using the **Line Tool (L)**, create an **4 ft**, vertical and place it as shown in the following image. Add a **10 pt** stroke for this path and for the color use your light blue from the **Color Palette**. Make sure that this new path stays selected and keep focusing on the **Effects** pane. Add a second stroke, drag it below the existing one, set the **Width** to **4 pt** and for the color use your dark blue from the **Color Palette**. 

(image: floorPlan25.jpg)



##Step 26

Return to the **Layers** panel and add a new layer using that same plus button. Select this new layer, rename it &quot;_doors_&quot; and drag in the the top of the panel. 

Pick the **Arc Tool (K)** and move to the tool options bar. Make sure that the **Arc mode** is active and select **Open Arc** from that drop-down menu. Move to your canvas and focus on the entry door. Hold the **Shift** key and create a perfect, **25 ft** arc as shown in the following image. Make sure that this path remains selected and move to the **Stroke** pane. 

Add  your light blue for the color and drag the **Line Weight** slider to **10 pt**. Check the **Projecting Cap** button and then move to the **Dash** and **Gap** boxes. First, check that tiny box to activate the custom  line dash feature and then enter **0 pt** in the first **Dash** box and **3 pt** in the first **Gap** box. You should end up with a nice, dashed path as  shown in the following image. 

(image: floorPlan26.jpg)



##Step 27

Using the **Line Tool (L)**, create a **2.5 ft** path and place it exactly as shown in the following image. Make sure that it stays selected and move to the **Stroke** pane. Add your light blue for the color, drag the **Line Weight** slider to **20 pt** and check  that **Projecting Cap** button. 

(image: floorPlan27.jpg)



##Step 28

Make sure that the vertical path made in the previous step is still selected and keep focusing on the **Effects** pane. Right click on the existing **Stroke** and go to **Duplicate** to easily duplicate that stroke. Select the newly added stroke and make sure that it lies below the existing one. Lower its **Width** to **5 pt** and replace the existing color with your dark blue. 

(image: floorPlan28.jpg)



##Step 29

Select the arc and the vertical path that make up your door and group then using the **Command + G** keyboard shortcut. Grouping these objects will make it easier for you to manipulate them together as a single object. 

Now, multiply your group and spread the copies as shown in the following image. You can duplicate your group using the classic **Command + C &gt; Command + V** keyboard shortcut or you can hold the **Option** button while clicking and dragging your selected shape. In some case you will need to flip your door group. This can be easily  done using the **Rotate and Transform &gt; Flip Horizontal** or **Vertical** commands. 

(image: floorPlan29.jpg)



##Step 30

Alternatively, you can create a half opened door using that same **Arc Tool (K)**. Select it, go to the tool options bar  and this time check the **Circular Arc mode**. First, click and drag a straight path across the gap kept for the door. Release the mouse button once you create the path and then move your cursor up to create your new arc. Hold down the **Shift** key while moving your cursor to constrain the angle to **15 degrees** increments, create a **45 degrees** arc and then click once on your canvas to get your new arc. 

Now, use that same **Copy Style** command to copy the style used for one of the  arcs that make up your opened doors and then use the **Paste Style** command to easily add the dashed line for the arc created in this step. 
Disable the **Snap to Grid** (**Shift + Command + '**) and then hit **Option + Command + '** (or go to **View &gt; Snap to Points**) to enable the **Snap to Points** feature. Using the **Line Tool**, create a simple oblique path that will connect your newest arc with the path that makes up the wall. Again, copy the style used for one of the straight paths that make up your opened doors and paste it into this oblique path. 

(image: floorPlan30.jpg)



##Step 31

Enable  the **Snap to Grid** (**Shift + Command + '**). Return to the **Layers** panel and add a new layer using that same plus button. Make sure that this new layer stays selected, rename it &quot;_dimension_&quot; and drag in the the bottom of the panel. 

Using the **Line Tool (L)**, create four, **5.5 ft** lines (two vertical and two horizontal) and place them as shown in the following image. Make sure that all these lines remain selected and go to  the **Stroke** pane. Click the color well and add your yellow from the **Color Palette**, drag the **Line Weight** slider to **10 pt** and then move to the dash and gap boxes and enter the attributes shown below. 

(image: floorPlan31.jpg)



##Step 32

Pick the **Line Tool (L)**, focus on the tool options bar and check the **Dimension Line mode**. Create a **36.5 ft**, vertical path and place it as shown in the following image. 

Make sure that your new path remains selected and go to the **Stroke** pane. Click that color well and replace the existing color with your yellow, drag the **Line Weight** slider to **15 pt** and then move to the **Label** pane. By default your label should be set to **Dimension** and **Length**. Select **Parallel** for the **Align** attribute and then adjust the **Location** and **Offset** properties about as shown below. 

Once you're done move to the **Text** pane to adjust the aspect of that label. Select that same **Ubuntu Mono** font, make it **Bold** and set the size to **100 pt**. Click the **Label** color well and replace the existing color with your dark blue and then click the **Border** color well and add your  yellow from the **Color Palette**. Finallly, set both **Margin** and **Corners** attributes to **20 pt**. In the end your yellow, dimension line should look like in the following image. 

(image: floorPlan32.jpg)



##Step 33

Using that same **Dimension Line mode** from the **Line Tool (L)**, create a **39 ft**, horizontal path and place it as shown in the following image. Add the same stroke and label attributes used for the vertical dimension line. The only attributes that you will probably want to adjust will be the **Offset** from the **Label** pane. Simply add a minus for the existing value and your label will move above the arrow as shown below. 

(image: floorPlan33.jpg)



##Step 34

Using the **Arc Tool (K)** create a **25 ft**, perfect arc as shown in the first image. Don't bother to adjust its attributes. Pick the **Type Tool (T)** and focus on the **Text** pane. Select the **Ubunto Mono** font, make it **Bold** and set the size to **100 pt**. Now, simply click on your canvas, add the &quot;_LOBBY_&quot; piece of text and make it yellow. 

(image: floorPlan34.jpg)



##Step 35

Select the yellow piece of text and the arc made in the previous step. Simply go to **Modify &gt; Place Text on Path** and your text will go along the selected path. 

(image: floorPlan35.jpg)



##Step 36

Disable the **Snap to Grid** (**Shift + Command + '**). Using the **Pen Tool (P)**, draw a curved path roughly as shown in the following image. 

Make sure that this new path stays selected and go to the **Stroke** pane. First, replace the existing color with your light blue and then drag the **Line Weight** slider to **15 pt**. Open the popup menu for the right line ending, select the arrow style shown below and then check the **Round Cap** button. If the arrowed end lies in the wrong spot you can easily  change its location by going to **Modify &gt; Reverse Path Direction**. 

(image: floorPlan36.jpg)



##Step 37

 Pick the **Type Tool (T)** and focus on the **Text** pane. Make sure that the **Ubuntu Mono** font is still active, make it **Bold** and set the size to **120 pt**. Once you're done simply click on your canvas, add the &quot;_Entry_&quot; piece of text and use your light blue for the color. 

(image: floorPlan37.jpg)



##Step 38

Get back to the **Grid** pane from the **Properties** panel and click the color wells that stand for the two **Spacing** attributes. Replace the existing color with white and don't forget to drag the **Alpha** slider to **15%**. 

Move to the **Canvas** pane from that same **Properties** panel, click the color well that stands for the background color and replace the existing color with **R=2 G=33 B=51**. 

(image: floorPlan38.jpg)



##Step 39

Finally, here's how you can easily export your entire design along with the grid and the canvas color. Go to **File &gt; Export** (or use the **Option + Command + E** keyboard shortcut) to open the **Export** window and simply select **Entire canvas** from the **Include** popup menu.
