In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a simple floor plan design in Graphic. For starters you will learn how to customize the grid and create a set of simple shapes using basic vector shape building techniques.

Using the Pen Tool, you'll create wall outlines and learn how to work with multiple layers. Moving on, you will learn how to add various types of labels and easily transfer them from one object to another. 

Taking full advantage of the Effects pane, you will learn how to add multiple strokes to a single shape and how to save and reuse styles. You'll also learn how to create arrowed, dashed and dimension lines and how to quickly edit them. 

Finally, you'll learn how to place text on a path and export your design with the grid and canvas background. 


##Step 1

For starters you will need to import the [**Ubuntu Mono font**](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/ubuntu). Tap the **Import** button from the **Documents Browser** to quickly import your font from the Dropbox/iCloud folder. 

(image: floorPlaniPad1A.jpg)


Next to that **Import** button you will find the **New Document** button. Tap it to create a new document and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. Focus the **Canvas** panel, make sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is enabled and then tap the **Units &amp; Scale** button to open the **Units &amp; Scale** pane. 

We're about to create a ‘to-scale’ technical design using the canvas scale settings. First, make sure that the **Base Unit** is set to inches and then move to the bottom of the pane and change the **Display Unit** from inches to feet. The actual paper size of the document will not change, only the displayed values and units are adjusted by this setting. 
Once you're done return to the **Canvas** panel and set the **Width** and **Height** to **63 ft**.

Next, you need to adjust your document's grid. Tap again that settings icon and switch from the **Canvas** panel to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** panel. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. 

Open the **Grid Settings** pane, enter **0.5 ft** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in that one **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and you will notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the stroke color is set to black. Tap  the fill color well and replace the existing color with **R=0 G=164 B=255** and then tap the line color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**, which will simply make the line invisible. 

 Pick the **Rectangle Tool**, focus on your canvas and create a **13 x 12.5 ft** shape — the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work. Make sure that this blue rectangle stays selected, go to the right side of your **Titlebar** and tap the ruler icon to open the **Geometry** panel. Focus on the **Position** attributes and simply enter the numbers mentioned in the following image to easily place your selected shape in the desired location.

##Step 3

Using the **Rectangle Tool**, create the series of rectangles shown in the following image and use the size attributes indicated below. Try to use somewhat similar fill colors, but don't struggle to get the exact tint. 

(image: floorPlaniPad3.jpg)



##Step 4

Using the **Rectangle Tool**, create a **13 x 14.5 ft** shape, fill it with a random yellow and place it as shown in the first image. 

Pick the **Pen Tool**, move to the newly opened tool pane and activate the **Add Point mode**. Focus on the bottom, left corner of your yellow rectangle and add two anchors points as shown in the first image. 

Switch to the **Path Selection Tool**, select the bottom, left anchor point and simply drag it **2.5 ft** up and **2.5 ft** to the right. In the end the shape made in this step should look like in the second image. 

(image: floorPlaniPad4.jpg)



##Step 5

Using the **Rectangle Tool**, create a **26 x 14.5 ft** shape, fill it with a random blue and place it as shown in the first image. Using the same tool, create a **6 x 3 ft** shape, and place it as shown in the second image. 

Switch to the **Move Tool**, select both shapes made in this step, focus on the left side of your **Titlebar** and tap the middle icon. Move from the **Arrange** to the **Combine** panel and then tap the **Subtract** button. In the end your blue shape should look like in the fourth image.

(image: floorPlaniPad5.jpg)



##Step 6

Using the **Rectangle Tool**, create a **6 x 16 ft** shape, fill it with white and place it as shown in the first image. Create second, white rectangles, make it **15 ft** wide and **4 ft** tall and then place it as shown in the second image. 

Switch to the **Path Selection  Tool**, focus on the newly opened tool pane and activate the **Add to Selection mode**. Simpy tap the two white shapes made in this step to select them and then tap the **Union** button from the **Combine**  panel. 

(image: floorPlaniPad6.jpg)



##Step 7

Focus on the right side of your **Titlebar** and tap the rightmost icon to open the **Layers** panel. First, double tap the existing layer and rename it &quot;_rooms_&quot;. Next, use the plus button located in the top, right corner of your panel to add a  second layer. Make  sure that this new layer stays selected, as the new objects you are about to create  will go here. Also, rename this new layer &quot;_walls_&quot;.

Move to your **Toolbar**, make the fill invisible and then tap the line color well. Replace the existing color with **R=169 G=217 B=237** and make sure that the **Alpha** slider is set to **100%**. Pick the **Pen Tool** and create the two paths that go around your existing set of shapes as shown in the following image. That bottom, **2.5 ft** gap between the paths will be the entry door.

Make sure that your two paths remain selected, get back to the right side of your **Titlebar** and tap the leftmost icon. Focus on the **Appearance** panel and set the **Stroke** to **60 pt**. In the end your two, blue paths should look like in the following image. 

You're going to use that light blue color numerous times throughout the tutorial. To ease your work you should save this particular color inside your **Color Palette**. Tap the color well from the **Stroke** panel or the one from your **Toolbar** and then simply drag the active color to one of the palette slots.

##Step 8
Using that same **Pen Tool**, create the straight paths that will make up the interior walls. Add a **20 pt** stroke for these paths and use your saved, light blue color from the **Color Palette**. Remember to leave a **2.5 ft** gap for each door. 
(image: floorPlaniPad8.jpg)



##Step 9

Return to the **Layers** panel and select the &quot;_room_&quot; layer as we are about to edit the shapes that lie inside this layer. 

Start with the top, left rectangle. Select it and focus on the **Appearance** panel. Simply tap the **Fill** color well, replace the existing color with **R=2 G=33 B=51** and drag the **Alpha** slider to **50%**. 

(image: floorPlaniPad9.jpg)



##Step 10

Make sure that your top, left rectangle is still selected and tap the **Label** button from the **Appearance** panel. First, select the **Dimension** label and then check the **Area** button which will automatically add a label that points the area of your selected object. Center this label using the  **Centered Alignment**  button or use the **Location** and **Offset** sliders to position your label in a different spot. 

With your shape still selected, tap the **Text Style** button to open the **Label Style** pane. First, select the **Ubuntu Mono** **Bold** font and set the size to **100 pt**. Tap the **Text Color** color well and replace the existing color with **R=255 G=180 B=0**. Again, you'll need this yellow plenty of times throughout the tutorial so make sure that you're saving it inside the **Color Palette**. Return to the **Label Style**  pane, make sure that there's no color set for the **Background Color** and skip the other attributes. 

(image: floorPlaniPad10.jpg)



##Step 11

Make sure that your labeled rectangle is still selected, focus on the left side of the **Titlebar** and tap that paperclip icon to open the **Edit** pane. Tap the **Copy Style** button and then return to your canvas. Select the yellow, blue, purple and red shapes, re-open that **Edit** pane and this time tap the **Paste Style** button. 

(image: floorPlaniPad11.jpg)



##Step 12

Select the white shape and focus on the **Appearance** panel. Tap the **Fill** color well, replace the existing color with **R=2 G=33 B=51** and drag the **Alpha** slider to **50%**. 

(image: floorPlaniPad12.jpg)



##Step 13

Select the two, orange shapes and focus on that same **Appearance**  panel. We’re going to assign a slightly darker color to these two rectangles: **R=0 G=23 B=41**. Don't forget to drag the **Alpha** slider to **50%**. 

(image: floorPlaniPad13.jpg)



##Step 14

Keep focusing on the two rectangles edited in the previous step. First, select the left one and go to the **Label** pane from the **Appearance** panel. This time set the **Label** to **Text** which will allow you to add any piece of text as a label. For this shape use the &quot;_CLOSET_&quot; text and then enter the rest of the attributes indicated in the following image. Don't forget to also move to the **Label Style**  pane and adjust the properties as shown below. 

Move to the rectangle on the right and add a somewhat similar text label. This time add the &quot;_WARDROBE_&quot; piece of text  and then enter all the attributes shown in the following image. 

(image: floorPlaniPad14.jpg)



##Step 15

Return to the **Layers** panel and add a new layer using that same plus button. Select this new layer, rename it &quot;_windows_&quot; and drag in the the top of the panel. 

Using the **Line Tool**, create a **4 ft**, vertical path and place it roughly as shown in the following image. Make sure that this new path stays selected and focus on the **Appearance** panel. Set the **Width**  to **60 pt** and then tap the color well that stands for this stroke and pick a random red. 

(image: floorPlaniPad15.jpg)



##Step 16

Use that same **Line Tool** to add a bunch of new, straight lines roughly as shown in the following image. 

(image: floorPlaniPad16.jpg)



##Step 17

Focus on one of your red lines and select it. Go to the **Effects** pane and add a second stroke using the plus button located in the bottom, right corner of the panel. 

Select this new stroke and for starters make sure that it lies below the other stroke. Keep in mind that you can easily move attributes inside the **Effects** panel using that icon made out of three horizontal lines. Now, drag the **Width** slider to **40 pt** and then tap the color well that stands for this new stroke. Make sure that the **Alpha** slider is set to **100%** and then replace the existing color with **R=2 G=33 B=51**. You'll need again this dark blue color so don't forget to quickly save it. 

(image: floorPlaniPad17.jpg)



##Step 18

Make sure that the red line edited in the previous step is still selected and keep focusing on the **Effects** panel. Add a new **Stroke** using that same plus button and make sure that it goes below the existing strokes. Focus on this new stroke, set the **Width** to **10 pt** and for the color add your light blue from the **Color Palette**. 

(image: floorPlaniPad18.jpg)



##Step 19

Make sure that the red line edited in the previous step is still selected and keep focusing on the **Effects** panel. Tap the color well that stands for the red stroke and simply replace that red with your light blue from the **Color Palette**. 

(image: floorPlaniPad19.jpg)



##Step 20

Make sure that the  line edited in the previous step is still selected and go to **Styles** panel. Simply tap the plus button that lies in the bottom, right corner of the **Styles** panel to save  the style of your selected, straight line. 

(image: floorPlaniPad20.jpg)



##Step 21

Select the remaining red lines and simply add your style from the **Styles** panel. 

(image: floorPlaniPad21.jpg)



##Step 22

Using the **Line Tool**, create a **6 ft**, horizontal path and two, **2.5 ft**, vertical paths and then place them as shown in the following image. Add a **20 pt** stroke for these new paths and pick a random red for the stroke color. 
(image: floorPlaniPad22.jpg)



##Step 23


Make sure that the three lines made in the previous step are still selected and  focus on the **Effects** panel. First, select the existing stroke and replace that red with your light blue from the **Color Palette**. Next, add a second stroke and drag it below the existing one. Set the **Width** for this new stroke to **8 pt** and replace the existing color with your dark blue from the **Color Palette**. 

(image: floorPlaniPad23.jpg)



##Step 24

Using the **Line Tool**, create an **11 ft**, vertical path and place it as shown in the following image. Add a **40 pt** stroke for this path and for the color use your light blue from the **Color Palette**. Make sure that this new path stays selected and keep focusing on the **Effects** panel. Add a second stroke, drag it below the existing one, set the **Width** to **20 pt** and for the color use your dark blue from the **Color Palette**. 

(image: floorPlaniPad24.jpg)



##Step 25

Using the **Line Tool**, create a **4 ft**, vertical path and place it as shown in the following image. Add a **10 pt** stroke for this path and for the color use your light blue from the **Color Palette**. Make sure that this new path stays selected and keep focusing on the **Effects** panel. Add a second stroke, drag it below the existing one, set the **Width** to **4 pt** and for the color use your dark blue from the **Color Palette**. 

(image: floorPlaniPad25.jpg)



##Step 26

Return to the **Layers** panel and add a new layer using that same plus button. Select this new layer, rename it &quot;_doors_&quot; and drag at the the top of the panel. 

Pick the **Arc Tool**, move to your canvas and focus on the entry door. Tap and hold with a second finger while dragging to create a perfect, **25 ft** arc as shown in the following image. Make sure that this path remains selected and move to the **Appearance**  panel. 

Set the stroke  **Width**   to **10 pt** and use your light blue for the stroke color. Move to the **Dash** button, tap it to open the **Line Dash** pane and then tap the **Dash Editor** button to create a custom line dash style. Enter **1 pt** in the top **Dash** box and **2 pt** in the top **Gap** box and you will end up with a nice, dashed path as  shown in the following image. 

(image: floorPlaniPad26.jpg)



##Step 27

Using the **Line Tool** , create a **2.5 ft** path and place it exactly as shown in the following image. Make sure that it stays selected and move to the **Effects** panel. Add your light blue for the color, drag the  **Width** slider to **20 pt** and don't forget to check  that **Projecting Cap** button. 

(image: floorPlaniPad27.jpg)



##Step 28

Make sure that the vertical path made in the previous step is still selected and keep focusing on the **Effects** panel. Tap the settings icon that stands for the existing stroke and then tap the **Duplicate** command to easily duplicate that particular attribute. Select the newly added stroke and make sure that it lies below the existing one. Lower its **Width** to **5 pt** and replace the existing color with your dark blue. 

(image: floorPlaniPad28.jpg)



##Step 29

Select the arc and the vertical path that make up your door and group them using the **Group** button from the **Arrange** panel. Grouping these objects will make it easier for you to manipulate them together as a single object. 

Now, multiply your group and spread the copies as shown in the following image. You can duplicate your group using the **Copy** and **Paste** buttons from the **Edit** pane. In some cases you will need to flip your door group. This can be easily  done using the flip  buttons from the **Geometry** panel. 

(image: floorPlaniPad29.jpg)



##Step 30

Alternatively, you can create a half opened door using that same **Arc Tool**. Create a new, **25 px** arc, make sure that it's perfect and add a random stroke color. 

Switch to the **Pen Tool**, activate the **Add Point mode** and then tap in the middle of your arc to add a new anchor point as show in the second image. 

Pick the **Path Selection Tool** and select the right anchor point that makes up your new arc. Move to the right side of your **Titlebar** and tap the **Delete** button to get rid of that selected point. 

Use the  **Copy Style** and **Paste Style** button from the **Edit** pane to copy the style used for one of the other arcs and paste it unto the arc created in this step. 

(image: floorPlaniPad30A.jpg)

Disable the **Snap to Grid**  and  enable the **Snap to Points** feature. 

Using the **Line Tool**, create a simple oblique path that will connect your newest arc with the path that makes up the wall. Again, copy the style used for one of the straight paths that make up your opened doors and paste it into this oblique path. 

(image: floorPlaniPad30B.jpg)


##Step 31

Enable  the **Snap to Grid**. Return to the **Layers** panel and add a new layer using that same plus button. Make sure that this new layer stays selected, rename it &quot;_dimension_&quot; and drag it at the bottom of the panel. 

Using the **Line Tool**, create four **5.5 ft** lines (two vertical and two horizontal) and place them as shown in the following image. Make sure that all these lines remain selected and go to  the **Appearance** panel. Tap the **Stroke** color well and add your yellow from the **Color Palette**, set the  **Width**   to **10 pt** and then move to the **Line Dash** pane and add the dash style checked in the following image. 

(image: floorPlaniPad31.jpg)



##Step 32

Pick the **Line Tool**, focus on the tool pane and check the **Dimension Line mode**. Create a **36.5 ft**, vertical path and place it as shown in the following image. 

Make sure that your new path remains selected and go to th**e Appearance** panel. Tap that **Stroke** color well and replace the existing color with your yellow, set the **Width**   to **15 pt** and then move to the **Label** pane. By default your label should be set to **Dimension** and **Length**. Select **Parallel** for the **Alignment**  attribute and then adjust the **Location** and **Offset** properties about as shown below. 

Once you're done, move to the **Text Style**  pane to adjust the aspect of that label. Select that same **Ubuntu Mono** font, make it **Bold** and set the size to **100 pt**. Tap the **Text Color**  color well and replace the existing color with your dark blue and then tap the **Background Color**  color well and add your  yellow from the **Color Palette**. Finally, set both **Margin** and **Corners** attributes to **20 pt**. In the end your yellow, dimension line should look like in the following image. 

(image: floorPlaniPad32.jpg)



##Step 33

Using that same **Dimension Line mode** from the **Line Tool**, create a **39 ft**, horizontal path and place it as shown in the following image. Add the same stroke and label attributes used for the vertical dimension line. The only attributes that you will probably want to adjust will be the **Offset** from the **Label** pane. Simply add a minus for the existing value and your label will move above the arrow as shown below. 

(image: floorPlaniPad33.jpg)



##Step 34

Using the **Arc Tool**, create a **25 ft**, perfect arc as shown in the first image. Don't bother to adjust its attributes. 

Pick the **Type Tool**, double tap inside the newly made text field to open the keyboard. First, select the **Ubunto Mono** font, make it **Bold**, set the size to **100 pt** and replace the existing color with your yellow. Once you're done type the &quot;_LOBBY_&quot; piece of text. 

(image: floorPlaniPad34.jpg)



##Step 35

Select the yellow piece of text and the arc made in the previous step and go to the **Path** panel. Simply tap the **Place Text on Path** button and your text will go along the selected path. 

(image: floorPlaniPad35.jpg)



##Step 36

Disable the **Snap to Grid** feature.  Using the **Pen Tool**, draw a curved path roughly as shown in the following image. 
Make sure that this new path stays selected and go to the **Appearance**  panel. First, replace the existing stroke color with your light blue and then drag the  **Width**  slider to **15 pt**. Open the **Arrows** pane, select the arrow styles checked below and then move to the **Effects** panel. Tap the existing stroke and check the **Round Cap** button. If the arrowed end lies in the wrong spot you can easily  change its location by tapping the **Reverse Path Direction** button from the **Path** panel.

(image: floorPlaniPad36.jpg)



##Step 37

 Pick the **Type Tool** and again double tap inside the newly added text field. Make sure that the **Ubuntu Mono** font is still active, make it **Bold**,  set the size to **120 pt** and replace the existing color with your light blue. Once you're done simply type the &quot;_Entry_&quot; piece of text.

(image: floorPlaniPad37.jpg)



##Step 38

Get back to the **Grid Settings**  pane from the **Grid &amp; Rulers** panel  and tap the color wells that stand for the two **Spacing** attributes. Replace the existing color with white and don't forget to drag the **Alpha** slider to **15%**. 

Move to the **Canvas** pane panel, tap the color well that stands for the **Background Color** and replace the existing color with **R=2 G=33 B=51**. 

(image: floorPlaniPad38.jpg)



##Step 39

Finally, here's how you can easily export your entire design along with the grid and the canvas color. First, save your document and return to the **Documents Browser**. 

Next, tap the **Share** button and pick the location where you want to save your document. Tap the document (or documents) that you want to save and then tap the **Share** button from the top, right corner of the screen. Simply enable the **Include Background** property, pick a file format, adjust the  other attributes as you wish and then tap the **Save** button.
