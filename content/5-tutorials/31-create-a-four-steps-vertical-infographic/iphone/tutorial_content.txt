In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a Four Steps Vertical Infographic in Picta Graphic for iPhone. 

For starters, you will learn how to set up a simple grid and how to create a set of pixel-perfect shapes. Using basic vector shape building techniques and some basic Effects attributes, you will learn to create the concentric white circles. 

Taking full advantage of the Layers panel, you will learn how to easily multiply and adjust content from your document. Moving on, you will learn how to create four line icons. 

Finally, you will learn how to add a bunch of text and a simple background for your final design. 





##Step 1

Start by tapping the   plus button from the top-left corner of your screen to create a new document. Tap the **Create Document** button and then choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar**, tap that ruler icon to open the **Properties** panel and then tap the **Canvas** pane. 

Set the **Width** to **680 px** and the **Height** to **1065 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and be sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled. When this setting is enabled, stroked objects are offset slightly to ensure that the stroke is drawn aligned to the pixel grid which guarantees a crisp look.

Re-open the **Properties** panel and this time tap the **Grid** pane. 

Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open the **Grid Settings** pane, enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.
