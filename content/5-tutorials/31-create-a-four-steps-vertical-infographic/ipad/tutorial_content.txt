In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a Four Steps Vertical Infographic in Picta Graphic for iPad. 

For starters, you will learn how to set up a simple grid and how to create a set of pixel-perfect shapes. Using basic vector shape building techniques and some basic Effects attributes, you will learn to create the concentric white circles. 

Taking full advantage of the Layers panel, you will learn how to easily multiply and adjust content from your document. Moving on, you will learn how to create four line icons. 

Finally, you will learn how to add a bunch of text and a simple background for your final design. 





##Step 1

From the **Documents Browser**, tap the plus button at the top-left corner of the **Titlebar** and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. Inside the **Canvas** pane, set the **Width** to **680 px** and the **Height** to **1065 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit and make sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled. When this setting is enabled, stroked objects are offset slightly to ensure that the stroke is drawn aligned to the pixel grid which guarantees a crisp look.

Next, you need to set up the document grid. Tap again that **Settings** icon and switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** pane. 

Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open that **Grid Settings** pane, enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and tap the **Line** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** to  simply make your line invisible. Tap the **Fill** color well and replace the existing color with **R=74 G=179 B=232**. 

Pick the **Ellipse Tool**, focus on your canvas and create a **220 px** circle.  Tap and drag, and then tap and hold with a second finger to easily create a circle. Using the **Move Tool**, select your shape and place it exactly as shown in the following image (_X: 340 px Y: 255 px_).

(image: StepsVerticalInfographiciPad2.jpg)



##Step 3

Focus on your **Toolbar** and replace the existing **Fill** color with black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**). Using the **Rectangle Tool**, create a **110 x 220 px** shape and place it as shown in the first image.  

Pick the **Move Tool** and select both shapes. Focus on the right side of your **Titlebar** and tap the middle icon. Move to the **Combine** pane and tap the **Subtract** command.

##Step 23


Go to the **Layers** panel and add a new layer. Drag it in the top of the panel, rename it &quot;_Icons_&quot; and make sure that it stays selected.

Focus on your bottom, black square. Pick the **Ellipse Tool**, create a **40 px** circle and place it as shown in the first image. With this new shape selected, move to the the **Effects** pane. 

First, make sure that the **Fill** is invisible and then select the **Stroke**. Drag that **Width** slider to **4 pt** and set the **Alignment** to **Inside**, and then tap the color well of this **Stroke**. Set the color to **R=54 G=63 B=68** and drag the **Alpha** slider to **100%**. 

Use the same tool to create a **20 px** circle. Place it as shown in the second image and apply the same **Effects** attributes used for the **40 px** circle. 

(image: StepsVerticalInfographiciPad23.jpg)



##Step 24

Now, you will need a grid every **1px** which simply means that you need to return to the **Grid Settings**  pane  and enter **1 px** in both  **Spacing** boxes. 

Using the **Line Tool**, create a **36 px**, vertical path and place it as shown in the first image. Add a **4 pt** stroke for this new path, set the **Alignment**  to **Center** and the color to **R=54 G=63 B=68**.

Make sure that your vertical path stays selected and switch to the **Rotate Tool**. Set the **Angle** to **90 degrees** and then tap that **Copy** button. 

(image: StepsVerticalInfographiciPad24.jpg)



##Step 25

Move up, to your next black square. Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, focus on the **Tool Options pane** and set the  **Radius** to **15**. Create a **36 x 36 px** shape, fill it with **R=54 G=63 B=68** and place it as shown in the first image. 

Switch to the **Rectangle Tool**, create a **40 x 18 px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the second image. 

Select both shapes made in this step and tap the **Subtract** command from the **Combine** pane. In the end, your shape should look like in the fourth image. 

(image: StepsVerticalInfographiciPad25.jpg)



##Step 26

Make sure that the shape made in the previous step stays selected and focus on the **Effects** pane. 

First, make the **Fill** invisible and set the **Stroke** color to **R=54 G=63 B=68**. Keep focusing on the **Stroke** and drag the  **Width** slider to **4 pt**. Be sure that the **Position** is set the **Center** and don't forget to check the **Rounded Join** button. Once you're done, copy the style of this shape.

Pick the **Ellipse Tool**  and create an **18 px** circle. Place it as shown in the second image and paste the style.

(image: StepsVerticalInfographiciPad26.jpg)



##Step 27

Move up, to your next black square. Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool** and set the  **Radius** to **5**. Create a **36 x 26 px** shape, place it as shown in the first image and paste the style. 

Switch to the **Rectangle Tool** and create a **6 x 10 px** shape. Place it as shown in the second image and paste the style. 

Using the **Line Tool**, create a **20 px**, vertical path. Place it as shown in the third image, paste the style, and then go to the **Effects** pane and check the **Rounded Cap** button. 

(image: StepsVerticalInfographiciPad27.jpg)



##Step 28

Move up, to your top black square. Pick the **Ellipse Tool** and create a **16 px** circle. Place it as shown in the first image and paste the style. 

Switch to the **Rectangle Tool** and create two, **2 px** squares. Place these new shapes as shown in the second image and paste the style.

(image: StepsVerticalInfographiciPad28.jpg)



##Step 29

Select both tiny squares added in the previous step and pick the **Rotate Tool**. Set the **Angle** to **45 degrees** and then tap that **Copy** button three times. In the end, things should look like in the third image. 

(image: StepsVerticalInfographiciPad29.jpg)



##Step 30

Select the shapes highlighted in the first image and **Group** them using the **Group** command from the **Arrange** pane. Make a copy of this group and place it as shown in the second image.

##Step 33


Go to the **Layers** panel and add a new layer. Drag it in the top of the panel, rename it &quot;_Text_&quot; and make sure that it stays selected.

Again, you will need a grid every **5 px**. Return to the **Grid &amp; Rulers**  pane and enter **5 px** in both  **Spacing** boxes. 

Pick the **Rectangle Tool** and create a **20 px** square. Fill this new shape with **R=54 G=63 B=68** and place it as shown in the first image. Keep focusing on this square and pick the **Path Selection Tool**. First, select the top anchor point and remove it using the **Delete** button from the **Titlebar**. Next, select the bottom anchor point and simply drag it **10 px** up. In the end, your square should turn into a triangle, as shown in the third image. 

(image: StepsVerticalInfographiciPad33.jpg)



##Step 34

Make three copies of your triangle. Select two of these copies and rotate them **180 degrees**. Place the three copies as shown in the following image.

##Step 35

Pick the **Text Tool** and double tap inside that new field. Select the **Futura font** and change the **Style** to **Bold**. Set the **Size** to **15**, change the color to **R=54 G=63 B=68** and set the **Text Alignment** to **Centered**. Make sure that the **Line Spacing** is set to **0.9** and then move to your canvas. 

Add the &quot;_STEP 01_&quot; piece of text, make your text field **130 px** wide and **20 px** tall, and then place it as shown in the following image. 

(image: StepsVerticalInfographiciPad35.jpg)



##Step 36

Add a second text field and lower the **Size** to **8 pt**. Create a **130 x 10 px** text field, place it as shown in the following image and add the &quot;_IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM_&quot; piece of text. 

(image: StepsVerticalInfographiciPad36.jpg)



##Step 37

Ad a third text field, change the **Style** to **Medium Italic** and increase the **Size** to **10 pt**. Change the color to **R=165 G=166 B=168** and then create a **130 x 75 px** text field. Place it as shown in the following image and add the text shown below.

(image: StepsVerticalInfographiciPad37.jpg)



##Step 38

Multiply your text fields, place the copies as shown below and don't forget to replace their content. 

(image: StepsVerticalInfographiciPad38.jpg)



##Step 39

Add a new text filed, change the **Style** to **Bold** and increase the **Size** to **15 pt**. Change the color back to **R=54 G=63 B=68** and then add the text shown below. Resize your text field to **305 x 40 px** and place it as shown in the following image.

(image: StepsVerticalInfographiciPad39.jpg)



##Step 40
