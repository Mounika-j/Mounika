In this Graphic for Mac tutorial we will create a professional logo design, using a coffee shop logo as an example.

We will use Graphic's text on path feature to easily create curved text labels around the top and bottom edges of the logo, and use the Appearance pane to customize the look of the logo's background.

##Step 1 - Create a New Document

Let's begin by creating a new document. Choose **File &gt; New (Control + N)** to bring up the **New Document** panel. Set the document units to **pixels**, and the document dimensions to **850** pixels wide by **650** pixels high.

##Step 2 - Draw an Ellipse

Select the **Ellipse Tool (O)** from your **Toolbar**. Hold the **Shift** key while dragging to crate a **360 px** circle. Make sure that it stays selected and open the **Properties** pane. 

Move to the **Alignment** pane and simply click the **Horizontal Centers** and **Vertical Centers** buttons which will bring your selection in the center of the canvas.

##Step 3 - Set the Fill and Stroke Styles

With the circle shape selected, switch to the **Effects** pane in the **Appearance** panel to customize the its settings. Click  the color well of the **Fill** item to change the circle's fill color. From the RGB color picker, choose **R= 110 G= 48 B= 0**.

Click  the **Stroke** color well, change the stroke color to **R= 130 G= 62 B= 0** and drag that **Alpha** slider to **100%**. Next, click on the **Stroke** item to view and edit its settings. Set the  **Width** to **10 pt** and the **Position** to **Outside**.

##Step 4 - Add a Second Stroke

Using the **Effects** pane you can add multiple strokes, fills, and effects to shapes. Click the plus button from the bottom of the panel and choose **'Stroke'** from the popup menu to add a second stroke to your circle shape. 

Seelct this new **Stroke** and set the **Width** to **5 pt**. Change the **Position** setting to **Outside** and set its color to white (**R= 255 G= 255 B= 255**).

##Step 5 - Set a Drop Shadow
Make sure that your circle is still selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** pane and simply check the  box that stands for the existing **Drop Shadow** effect to activate it. 

Select it and enter **0** in the **X** box and **2** in the **Y** box. Drag the **Size** slider to **5 pt** and then click the color well that stands for this **Drop Shadow** effect. Make sure that the color is set to black and drag the **Alpha** slider to **75%**.

##Step 6 - Add a Text Object

We will create each text label in its own layer. Create a new layer by choosing **Arrange &gt; New Layer (Shift + Command + N)**. 

To create the first text object, choose the **Text Tool (T)** from the **Toolbar** and click and drag a text area on top of the circle. From the **Tool Options** bar, choose the **American Typewritter** font, set the style to **Regular** and the size to **45 pt**. Change the text color to **white** and type the label's text, **'Smooth Roast'** for this example.

##Step 7 - Create the Text Path

Select the **Ellipse Tool (O)** again from the **Toolbar**. Create a **270 px** circle and don't forget to center it using the same buttons from the **Alignment** pane. 

This smaller circle doesn't need a color for fill/stroke. Simply disable the active **Fill** and **Stroke** from the **Effects** pane.

##Step 8

Choose the **Move Tool (V)** from the **Toolbar** and with the **Shift** key pressed click to select both the text object and smaller circle shape. Go to **Modify &gt; Place Text on Path** to bind the text to the circle path.

##Step 9

By default, the text begins at the bottom of the circle. To position the text on the path, click on the **round handle** next to the first character and **drag** it along the path.

##Step 10

Now, you will need a grid every **5 px**. This  simply means that you need to return to the **Grid**  pane from the **Properties** panel and enter **5 px** in both  **Spacing** boxes. 
 
Create a new layer by going to **Arrange &gt; New Layer (Shift + Command + N)**. Using the **Text Tool (T)**, create a second text object. Use the same style settings as before and add the **'Coffee Company'** line of text. 
 Using  the **Ellipse Tool (O)**, create a **325 px** and don't forget to center it. Make sure that it stays selected, go to the **Effects** pane and simply disable the active **Fill** and **Stroke**.

##Step 11

As before, select both the text object and circle path using the **Move Tool (V)**. Go to **Modify &gt; Place Text on Path** to bind the text to the path. 

The text will initially be placed on the outside of the path. To place the text on the inside of the path, choose **Modify &gt; Reverse Path Direction**. Click and drag the **round handle** to position the text at the bottom of the label.

##Step 12

Create a new layer by going to **Arrange &gt; New Layer (Shift + Command + N)**. 

Using the **Ellipse Tool (O)**, create a **240 px** circle and don't foget to center it. Set this circle's **Fill** color to **R= 110 G= 48 B= 0** and then select the **Stroke**. Increase the **Width** to **2,5 pt**, set the **Position** to **Inside** and change the color to white.

##Step 13

Graphic can import vector shapes and clip art from PDF and SVG files. You can find vector design resources on many different websites, [openclipart.org](http://www.openclipart.org/) hosts a large library of public domain vector clipart in SVG format that can be used in Graphic.

Import the [CoffeeBean.svg](http://www.indeeo.com/idraw/tutorials/content/02-design-a-logo-with-curved-text/CoffeeBean.svg) file using **File &gt; Open (Comnand + O)**, or by dragging the file to the Graphic icon in the dock. The file will open as a new Graphic document. Select the coffee bean shape and copy it to the pasteboard using **Edit &gt; Copy (Command + C)**. Switch back to the tutorial document. Create a new layer **(Shift + Command + N)** and paste the shape using **Edit &gt; Paste (Command + P)**.

##Step 14

With the bean shape selected, set its **Fill** color to white from the **Toolbar**. Using the **Move Tool (V)**, you can scale and position the coffee bean shape to fit nicely inside the center of the logo. 

To create two more coffee bean shapes, you can either use the copy and paste commands or **option-drag** the first shape with the **Move Tool**. Rotate, scale, and position the bean shapes to finish the inner part of the logo.

##Step 15

To create the smaller text labels, choose the **Text Tool (T)** from the **Toolbar** and click and drag a text area on the left side of the logo. Choose the **Arial** font, set the style to **Bold** and change the size to **16 pt**. Set the text alignment to **Center** and the color to **R= 255 G= 188 B= 128**. Type **'Since'** for the left side label.

Using the same attributes, create the right side label with the text **'1981'**.
