In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a volume control  in Graphic for iPhone. 

For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create the main shape using the Rounded Rectangle Tool and the Effects pane. Next, you'll create the speaker icon using basic tools and vector shapes building techniques. 

Finally, you'll learn how to create the volume bar and how to add a simple image for the background. 





##Step 1

Start by tapping the   plus button from the top-left corner of your screen to create a new document. Tap the **Create Document** button and then choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar**, tap that ruler icon to open the **Properties** panel and then tap the **Canvas** pane. Set both **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and be sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is enabled. This feature ensures that all shapes that are aligned to the pixel grid will have solid, crisp strokes.

Re-open the **Properties** panel and this time tap the **Grid** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open the **Grid Settings** pane and enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and you will notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the line color is set to black. Tap  the fill color wheel to open the color panel and replace the existing color with black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**). Move to the  line color wheel, tap it and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**, which will simply make your line invisible. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, focus on the newly opened tool pane and drag the  **Radius** slider to **25**. Move to your canvas and  create a **205 px** rounded square.
