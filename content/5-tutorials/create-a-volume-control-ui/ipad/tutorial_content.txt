In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a volume control  in Graphic for iPad.

For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create the main shape using the Rounded Rectangle Tool and the Effects pane. Next, you'll create the speaker icon using basic tools and vector shapes building techniques. 

Finally, you'll learn how to create the volume bar and how to add a simple image for the background. 





##Step 1

For this tutorial we'll create a new **600 x 600 pixel** document. From the **Documents Browser**, tap the plus button at the top-right corner of the **Titlebar** and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. Go to the **Canvas** panel, set the **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and make sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is enabled. The **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature ensures that all shapes which are aligned to the pixel grid will have solid, crisp strokes.

Next, you need to adjust your document's grid so switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** panel. Make that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. 

Finally, open the **Grid Settings** pane. Enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in that one **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and you will notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the line color is set to black. Tap  the fill color wheel to open the color panel and replace the existing color with black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**). Move to the  line color wheel, tap it and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**, which will simply make your line invisible. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, focus on the newly opened tool pane and drag the  **Radius** slider to **25**. Move to your canvas and  create a **205 px** rounded square.

##Step 3

Make sure that your rounded square is still selected, focus on the right side of your **Titlebar** and tap the leftmost icon. Move to the **Effect** panel, simply tap the color wheel that stands for the existing **Fill** and drag the **Alpha** slider to **30%**.

##Step 4

Return to your **Toolbar**, make sure that the line is still invisible and then set the fill color to **R=24 G=169 B=250**. 

Pick the **Rectangle Tool**, create a **20 px** square and place it exactly as shown in the following image.

##Step 14

Get back to your **Toolbar**, make sure that the line is invisible and then set the fill color to white. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, focus on the tool pane and drag the  **Radius** slider to **3**. Move to your canvas, create a **10 px** rounded square and place it as shown in the first image. 

Create nine, similar shapes and align them in a perfect row as shown in the second image. Once you're done, switch to the **Path Selection Tool** and  activate the second tool mode. Select all these tiny, rounded squares, focus on the **Combine****** panel and tap the **Make Compound Path** button.
