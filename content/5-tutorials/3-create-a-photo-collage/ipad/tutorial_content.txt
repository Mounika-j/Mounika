In this Graphic tutorial you will learn how to create a photo collage design with various layouts using imported images and photos. 

Graphic can import images and photos from different file types, including PNG, JPEG, TIFF, etc., and has tools for cropping, scaling, and masking images within shapes.





##Step 1 - Create a New Document

For this tutorial we'll create a new **798 x 600 pixel** document. From the **Documents Browser**, tap the plus button at the top-right corner of the **Titlebar** and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. In the **Canvas** pane set the **Width** to **798px** and the **Height** to **600px**, select **Pixels** for the base units, and verify that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled. When this setting is enabled, stroked objects are offset slightly to ensure that the stroke is drawn aligned to the pixel grid which guarantees a crisp look.

##Step 2 - Customize the Grid

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** pane in the **Settings** popover. Ensure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or **Snap to Grid**. Finally, simply tap the **Grid Spacing** section, enter **6 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **6 px** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 3 - Draw the Background Shape

Next, we'll draw a shape that will act as our background for the collage. In this case we'll use a rounded rectangle, but we could also use a regular rectangle or other large shape, depending on the desired style for the collage.
Focus on your **Toolbar** and tap the **Fill** color well. Make sure that the color is set to white (**R=0 G=0 B=0**) and then  tap the **Line** color well. Drag that **Alpha** slider to **0%** which will simply make your line invisible. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, focus on the newly opened **Tool Options** pane and drag the  **Radius** slider to **6**. Move to yor canvas,  create a **786 x 588 px** shape and place it as shown below — the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.

##Step 4 - Create an Image Placeholder

To design the layout of the collage, we'll create placeholder shapes where we want the final images to appear. Return to your **Toolbar** and replace the existing **Fill** color with **R=128 G=128 B=128**. 

Select the **Rectangle Tool** from the **Toobar** and create **492 x 218 px** shape. Make sure that it stays selected, focus on the right side of your **Titlebar** and tap that ruler icon to open the **Geometry** pane. Set both **Pisition** attributes to **12 px**.  

This rectangle shape will designate the size and position of one of the images in our collage.

##Step 5 - Create the Full Layout

Next, we'll create the other rectangles needed to complete the layout. Using the **Rectangle Tool** create the next three rectangles:

• Position: **X: 12 px**, **Y: 336 px**, Size: **282 px width**, **252 px height**.
• Position: **X: 300 px**, **Y: 336 px**, Size: **204 px width**, **252 px height**.
• Position: **X: 510 px**, **Y: 12 px**, Size: **276 px width**, **576 px height**.

The layout should look like the screenshot below.

##Step 6 - Set an Image Fill and Choose the Image

Switch to the **Move Tool** and select the top left placeholder shape. Focus on the right side of your Titlebar and tap the leftmost icons. Focus on the **Appearance** pane, tap the **Image** command and then tap the **Change Image** button. Select the image you'd like to use for this placeholder. By default, the image will be scaled to fit inside the rectangle shape.

##Step 7 - Scale and Position the Image

To scale and position an image within a shape you can double-tap on that shape using the **Move Tool**. This will activate the **Image Tool**. With the **Image Tool** active, you can scale the image using the draggable resize handle (bottom right corner) or you can simply move the image within the shape to reposition it. You can also scale your image using that **Image** pane. 

Scale and position the image to fit nicely within the shape and then tap outside your shape to deactivate the **Image Tool**.

##Step 9 - Add the Other Images

Using the same steps as before, set different image fills for each of the other placeholder shapes. By scaling and positioning the images within the shapes you can create a photo collage similar to the one shown below.

By using different shapes and sizes for the image placeholders you can create entirely different collage styles. For example, you can use rounded rectangles for the placeholders.

Other types of shapes can also be used to clip image fills to create dramatically different effects. Try different combinations to create unique artistic layouts.
