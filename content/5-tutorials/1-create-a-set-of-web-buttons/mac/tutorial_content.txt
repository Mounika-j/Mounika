In this Graphic for Mac tutorial we will create a set of web buttons. Using the techniques in this tutorial you can quickly create a large variety of button styles and change their appearance easily.

For starters, you will learn how to set up a simple grid. Using the Rounded Rectangle Tool, you will learn how to easily create a pixel-perfect vector shape. Taking full advantage of the Effects pane, you will learn how to add shading and highlights for your button shape.

Moving on, you will learn how to add a simple piece of text and how to stylize it. Finally, you will learn how to easily adjust the style of your button.





##Step 1 - Create a New Document

For this tutorial we'll create a new 890 x 500 pixel document. Choose **File &gt; New (Command + N)** to bring up the 'New Document' panel. Set the document units to **pixels**, and the document dimensions to **890** pixels wide by **500** pixels high.

##Step 2 - Customize the Grid

To easily create and position uniform button shapes we can first set up our document's grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. Change the **X Spacing** and **Y Spacing** to **10 px** and enable **Snap to Grid (Shift + Command + ')**.

##Step 3 - Draw the Button Shape

Select the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift-M)** from the **Toolbar**. The **Corner Radius** used when creating rounded rectangles can be set from the **Tool Options** bar directly above the canvas area. Set the **Corner Radius** to **6 pt** and draw a rounded rectangle with a width of **210 px** and a height of **40 px**.

##Step 4 - Set the Fill and Stroke Styles

With the rounded rectangle shape selected, switch to the **Effects** pane in the **Appearance** panel to customize its ettings. Click on the color well of the **Fill** item to change the button's fill color. From the RGB color picker, choose **R: 0 G: 144 B: 255**.

Click on the **Stroke** color well, change the  color black (**R: 0 G: 0 B: 0**) and drag that **Alpha** slider to **50%**. Next, click on the **Stroke** item to view and edit the stroke settings. Set the  **Width** to **1 pt** and the **Position** to **Outside**.

##Step 5 - Add a Second Fill

To give the button some depth we're going to add a second fill with a semi-transparent gradient. Click on the plus button at the bottom of the panel and choose **'Fill'** from the popup menu to add another fill.

Items in the **Effects** pane can be easily dragged and droped to re-order them. Drag the new fill item and place it directly under the first fill. This new order will cause the second fill to draw directly after the first fill, rather than after the stroke.

_Note: in this case the visual appearance doesn't change since the stroke is positioned outside of the path, however if the stroke was positioned inside or centered the second fill would now appear under the stroke rather than on top of it._

##Step 6 - Set the Gradient Fill

To change the second fill to a gradient click on the item in the **Effects** pane to view its settings and choose **Linear Gradient** from the **Type** popup. Change the gradient angle to **90˚** and then focus on the gradient bar. Click  the left color stop, set the color to black and drag that **Alhpa** slider to **20%**. Click the right color stop, set the color to white and drag the **Alpha** slider to **20%**.

##Step 7 - Set a Drop Shadow

Next, we'll add a slight drop shadow to the button. Click  the check box next to the **Drop Shadow** item in **Effects** pane to enable the effect. Click on the drop shadow's color well, change the color to black and set the **Alpha** atributes to **35%**. Click on the **Drop Shadow** item to view and edit its settings. Set the **offset** to **X: 0 pt** and **Y: 1 pt** to position the shadow slightly below the button. Drag that **Size** slider to **2 pt** and turn off the **'Clip shadow by shape'** setting.

##Step 8 - Set the Top Inner Border

To add a highlight at the top of button we're going to use the **Inner Shadow** effect. Click on the check box next to the **Inner Shadow** item in **Effects** pane to enable the effect. 

Click on the **Inner Shadow**'s color well, change the color to white and drag that **Alpha** slider to **50%**. From the **Inner Shadow**'s settings pane, set the **offset** to **X: 0 pt** and **Y: 2 pt** and set the **Size** to **0 pt**. Also, set the **Blend Mode** to **Overlay**. This will create a solid light-colored line bordering the top of the button.

##Step 9 - Set the Bottom Inner Border

To create a dark highlight at the bottom of the button we're going to add another **Inner Shadow** effect and repeat the steps from before. Click on the plus button at the bottom of the panel and choose **'Inner Shadow'** from the popup menu to add another **Inner Shadow** to your button shape.

Click on the **Inner Shadow**'s color well, change the color to black and drag that **Alpha** slider to **15%**. From the **Inner Shadow**'s settings pane, set the **offset** to **X: 0 pt** and **Y: -2 pt** and set the  **Size** to **0 pt**. This time we'll keep the **Blend Mode** set to **Normal**. This will create a solid dark-colored line bordering the bottom of the button. The screenshot below shows the full effects stack applied to the button.

##Step 10 - Add the Text Label

Select the **Text Tool (T)** from the **Toolbar** and click and drag a text area centered on top of the button. From the **Tool Options** bar, choose the font **Helvetica**, change the style to **Bold** and set the size to **16 pt**. Set the text color to white and change the text alignment to **centered**. Type the button's text in the text area.

##Step 11 - Set the Text Shadow

With the text object selected, enable the **Drop Shadow** effect by clicking on the checkbox next to it in the **Effects** pane. 

Click on the **Drop Shadow**'s color well and change the shadow color to black, **R: 0 G: 0 B: 0 A: 100%**. Click on the **Drop Shadow** item to view and edit its settings. Set the **offset** to **X: 0 pt** and **Y: -1 pt** and set the **Size** to **0 pt**.

##Step 12 - Create the Pressed State Button

Next, we'll create a copy of the button for a pressed state version. Switch to the **Move Tool (V)** and select both the button and text label using the **Shift** key, or by dragging a selection area. 

You can duplicate the button by using the copy and paste commands (**Command + C &gt; Command + V**) or by **option-dragging** the selection.

After duplicating, move the second button next to first. To create the pressed state, now select only the second button's shape (without the text label) and view the gradient fill settings in the **Effects** pane. Click on the **reverse gradient** button and voila, a pressed button… it's that easy.

##Step 13 - Change Button Colors

Creating alternate versions of our button in different colors is just as easy as creating the pressed state... all we need to do is change one setting, the first **Fill** color. Since all of the other effects are applied on top of this base color, this is the only setting we need to change to create a variety of different colored buttons.

##Step 14 - More Button Shapes

Using the effects stack we've created as a base style, you can create many different types of buttons. For example, using a larger corner radius with the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)** you can create capsule shaped buttons. 

To apply a style from one shape to another shape you can use the **Copy Style (Option-Shift-C) / Paste Style (Option-Shift-V)** commands.
