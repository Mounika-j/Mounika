In this Graphic for Mac tutorial we will create a set of web buttons. Using the techniques in this tutorial you can quickly create a large variety of button styles and change their appearance easily.

For starters, you will learn how to set up a simple grid. Using the Rounded Rectangle Tool, you will learn how to easily create a pixel-perfect vector shape. Taking full advantage of the Effects pane, you will learn how to add shading and highlights for your button shape.

Moving on, you will learn how to add a simple piece of text and how to stylize it. Finally, you will learn how to easily adjust the style of your button.





##Step 1 - Create a New Document

For this tutorial we'll create a new **680 x 890 pixel** document. From the **Documents Browser**, tap the plus button at the top-right corner of the **Titlebar** and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. In the **Canvas** pane set the **Width** at **680** and **Height** to **890**, select **Pixels** for the base units, and verify that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled. When this setting is enabled, stroked objects are offset slightly to ensure that the stroke is drawn aligned to the pixel grid which guarantees a crisp look.

##Step 2 - Customize the Grid

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** section in the **Settings** popover. Ensure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, simply tap the **Grid Spacing** section, enter **10px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **6px** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 3 - Draw the Button Shape

Focus on the **Toolbar** and you will notice that by default the **Fill** color is set to white while the **Line** color is set to black. Tap the **Fill** color well and set its color at **R=0 G=144 B=255** and then  tap the **Line** color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**, which will  make your line invisible. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, focus on the newly opened tool pane and drag the  **Radius** slider to **6**. Move to yor canvas and simply create a **210 x 40 px** shape — the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.

##Step 4 - Set the Fill and Stroke Styles

Make sure that your rounded rectangle stays selected, focus on the right side of your **Titlebar** and tap the leftmost icon. Go to the **Effects** pane and simply tap the existing **Stroke**. 

Make sure that the **Width** slider is set to **1 pt**, select the **Outside Alignment** button, and then tap the color well of your **Stroke**. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **50%** and make sure that the color is set to black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**).

##Step 5 - Add a Second Fill

Make sure that your rounded rectangle stays selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** pane and add a second **Fill** using the plus button located in the bottom, left corner of your pane. Select this new **Fill**, simply tap its hamburger icon and drag it right below the existing **Fill**.

##Step 6 - Set the Gradient Fill

Make sure that your rounded rectangle is still selected, keep focusing on the **Effect** pane and tap the color well that stands for the bottom **Fill**. Tap the **Gradient Fill** and **Linear** buttons, set the **Angle** to **-90 degrees** and then move to the **Gradient** colors stops. 

Select the left one, set the color to black and drag the **Alpha** slider to **20%**, and then select the right one, set the color to white and drag the **Alpha** slider to **20%**.

##Step 7 - Set a Drop Shadow

Make sure that your rounded rectangle is still selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** pane and  check the round checkbox that stands for the existing **Drop Shadow** to activate it. 

Enter **0** in the **X** and **1** in the **Y** box, drag the **Blur** slider to **2**, and then tap the color well that stands for this effect. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **35%** and make sure that the color is set to black.

##Step 8 - Set the Top Inner Border
Make sure that your rounded rectangle is still selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** pane and activate the existing **Inner Shadow** effect. 

Enter **0** in the **X** box and **2** in the **Y** box, drag the **Blur** slider to **0**, and then tap the color well that stands for your effect. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **50%** and make sure that the color is set at white. Return to the **Effect** pane and tap the cogwheel icon that stands for your **Inner Shadow** effect to open that context menu. Go to **Blend Mode**, select the **Overlay** blend mode and then tap the **Done** button.

##Step 9 - Set the Bottom Inner Border

Make sure that your rounded rectangle is still selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** pane and add a second **Inner Shadow** using that same plus button. Select this new effect, make sure that it lies below the existing **Inner Shadow**, and then enter the attributes shown in the following image.

##Step 10 - Add the Text Label

Pick the **Text Tool** and simply  double tap inside that new field. Set the color to white and select the **Helvetica Bold** font. Set the font size to **16** and then add the &quot;_Sign Up_&quot; piece of text. Using the **Move Tool**, select this little piece of text and place it as shown in the following image.

##Step 11 - Set the Text Shadow

Make sure that your piece of text stays selected and focus on the **Effects** pane. Activate the existing **Drop Shadow** effect and enter the attributes shown in the following image.

##Step 12 - Create the Pressed State Button

Now, you need to duplicate your button. Using the **Move Tool**, select your rounded rectangle along with the  piece of text. Focus on the left side of your **Titlebar** and tap that paperclip icon to open the **Edit** pane. Tap the **Copy** and **Paste** commands to easily duplicate your selection. 

Move to your canvas, select the fresh copies and place them roughly as shown in the following image. Select that new, rounded rectangles and focus on the **Effects** pane. Open the gradient used for the bottom fill and simply tap the **Reverse Gradient** button.

##Step 13 - Change Button Colors

Creating alternate versions of our button in different colors is just as easy as creating the pressed state... all we need to do is change one setting, the first **Fill** color. Since all of the other effects are applied on top of this base color, this is the only setting we need to change to create a variety of different colored buttons.

##Step 14 - More Button Shapes

Using the effects stack we've created as a base style, you can create many different types of buttons. For example, using a larger corner radius with the **Rounded Rectangle Tool** you can create capsule shaped buttons. 
To apply a style from one shape to another shape you can use the **Copy Style / Paste Style** commands from that same **Edit** pane.
