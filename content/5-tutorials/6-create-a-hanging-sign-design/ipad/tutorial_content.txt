In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a simple hanging sign in  Graphic for iPad. 

For starters you will learn how to set up a simple grid and how to create the main shapes using basic tools and vector shape building techniques. Taking full advantage of the Effects pane you will learn how to add complex shading and highlights for your shapes. In the end, you will learn how to add some simple text to your desgin. 





##Step 1

From the **Documents Browser**, tap the plus button at the top-left corner of the **Titlebar** and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. Go to the **Canvas** pane, set the **Width** to **600 px** and the **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and make sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled.

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open that **Grid Settings** pane, enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and   notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the line color is set to black. Tap the fill color well and set its color to **R=255 G=185 B=0** and then tap the line color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**. This will simply make your line invisible. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, focus on the newly opened **Tool Options** pane and drag the **Radius** slider to **10**. Move yo your canvas and simply create a **250 x 150 px** shape.

##Step 3

Make sure that the **Rounded Rectangle Tool** is still active, focus on the **Tool Options** pane and drag the  **Radius** slider to **7 pt**. Move to your canvas, create a **240 x 140 px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the following image. The grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature should ease your work.

Select the left one and set its color to **R=212 G=212 B=212** and then select the right one and add the same color.  Simply tap on the gradient bar and you will get a new gradient slider. Select it, set the color to **R=238 G=238 B=238** and drag it to the right until the **Location** tooltip shows **95%**. Keep focusing on the gradient bar, add another six gradient sliders and then use the color and **Location** attributes shown in the following image.
