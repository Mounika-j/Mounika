In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a simple hanging sign in  Graphic for Mac. 

For starters you will learn how to set up a simple grid and how to create the main shapes using basic tools and vector shape building techniques. Taking full advantage of the Effects pane you will learn how to add complex shading and highlights for your shapes. In the end, you will learn how to add some simple text to your desgin. 





##Step 1

Go to **File &gt; New (Command + N)** to bring up the **New Document** window. Select the **Grid** document style, set the document units to **pixels**, and set the document dimensions to **600** pixels wide by **500** pixels high.

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. If the **Properties** panel is not currently visible, you can easily open it using the ruler icon that lies above the **Layers** panel. Change the grid **X Spacing** and **Y Spacing** to **5**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0** and enable **Snap to Grid (Command + Shift + ')**.

Keep in mind that you can quickly enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature using the  **Command +  '** and  **Command + Shift + '** keyboard shortcuts.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the stroke color is set to black. 

Click  the **Fill** color well and set the  color to **R=255 G=185 B=0** and then click  the **Stroke** color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**. This will simply make your stroke invisible. Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)**, focus on the Tool Options bar and drag the **Corner Radius** slider to **10 pt**. Move to your canvas and simply create a **250 x 150 px** shape.

##Step 3

Return to your **Toolbar** and replace the existing **Fill** color with a simple white (**R=255 G=255 B=255**). 

Make sure that the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)** is still active, focus on the Tool Options bar and drag the **Corner Radius** slider to **7 pt**. Move to your canvas, create a **240 x 140 px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the following image. The grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature should ease your work.

##Step 4

Using the **Move Tool (V)**, select both shapes made so far, focus on the **Path Tools** pane from the **Properties** panel and simply click the **Subtract** button. In the end things should look like in the second image.

##Step 5

Make sure that your shape stays selected and focus on the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel. If the **Appearance** pane is not currently visible, you can easily open it using the leftmost icon that lies above the **Layers** panel. 

Focus on the existing **Fill** and select **Linear Gradient** from the **Type** drop-down menu. Set the angle to **45 degrees** and then move to the gradient sliders. Select the left one and set its color to **R=212 G=212 B=212** adn then select the right one and add the same color**. Simply click on the gradient bar and you will get a new gradient slider. Select it, set the color to **R=238 G=238 B=238** and drag it to the right until the **Location** tooltip shows **95%**. Keep focusing on the gradient bar, add another six gradient sliders and then use the color and **Location** attributes shown in the following image.
