Re-open the **Properties** panel and this time tap the **Grid** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open the **Grid Settings** pane and enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and   notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the line color is set to black. Tap the fill color well and set its color to **R=255 G=185 B=0** and then tap the line color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**. This will simply make your line invisible. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, focus on the newly opened **Tool Options** pane and drag the **Radius** slider to **10**. Move yo your canvas and simply create a **250 x 150 px** shape.
