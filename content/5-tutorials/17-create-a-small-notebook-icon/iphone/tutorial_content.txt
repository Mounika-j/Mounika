In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a small notebook icon in  Graphic for iPhone. 

For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create the main shapes using basic tools and vector shape building techniques. Next, you will learn two techniques that can be used to perfectly align your shapes and paths to the pixel grid. 

Taking full advantage of the Effects pane, you will learn how to add smooth shading and sleek highlights for your objects. Finally, you will learn how to add and adjust linear or radial gradients.





##Step 1

Start by tapping the   plus button from the top-left corner of your screen to create a new document. Tap the **Create Document** button and then choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar**, tap that ruler icon to open the **Properties** panel and then tap the **Canvas** pane. Set both **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and be sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled. When this setting is enabled, stroked objects are offset slightly to ensure that the stroke is drawn aligned to the pixel grid which guarantees a crisp look.

Re-open the **Properties** panel and this time tap the **Grid** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open the **Grid Settings** pane, enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and   notice that by default the **Fill** color is set to white while the **Line** color is set to black. Tap the **Fill** color well and set its color to **R=74 G=196 B=255** and then tap the **Line** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this  will simply make your **Line** invisible. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, focus on the newly opened **Tool Options** pane and drag that  **Radius** slider to **5**. Move to yor canvas and  create a **130 x 130 px** shape - the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.

##Step 3

Using the **Move Tool**, select your shape and open the **Properties** panel. Go to the **Arrange** pane and simply tap the  **Horizontal** and the  **Vertical** buttons to bring your rounded square in the center of the canvas.

##Step 4

Make sure that your shape is still selected and simply tap and hold to open the context menu. First, tap the **Copy** command, and then reopen that context menu and tap the **Paste in Place** command. This will simply add a copy of your selection in the same place.

##Step 5

Move to  your **Toolbar** and  replace the existing **Fill** color with **R=1 G=173 B=14**. Pick the **Rectangle Tool**, create a **130 x 100 px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the first image. Once again, the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will come in handy. 

Switch to the **Path Selection Tool**, focus on the  **Tool Options** pane and activate the **Add to Selection** mode. Select the copy of your blue shape along with that green rectangle, go to the **Combine** pane from the **Properties** panel and simply tap that **Intersect** button.

##Step 6

Make sure that the shape made in the previous step is still selected, focus on the right side of your **Titlebar** and tap the leftmost icon to open the **Appearance** panel. Go to the **Effects** pane and tap the color well of the existing **Fill**. 

Tap the **Gradient**  and the **Linear** buttons, set the **Angle** to -**90 degrees** and then  move to the gradient color stops. Select the left one and set its color to **R=255 G=240 B=190** and then select the right one and set its color to **R=235 G=210 B=160**. Keep focusing on this linear gradient and simply tap on the gradient bar to add a new gradient color stop. Select it, set the color to **R=255 G=230 B=180** and then drag it to the left until the **Location** tooltip shows **10%**. Using the same technique, add a fourth gradient color stop. Select it, set the color to **R=255 G=220 B=170** and drag it to **60%**.

##Step 7

Make sure that your gradient filled shape stays selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** pane and add a second **Fill** using the plus button from the top, right corner of your pane. 

Tap on its right side handle to drag this new **Fill** below the existing one and then tap its color well. Again, tap the **Gradient**  and the **Linear** buttons, set the **Angle** to -**90 degrees** and then  move to the gradient color stops. Select the left one, move it to **80%**, replace the existing color with to **R=255 G=230 B=180** and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**. Move to the right gradient color stop, set the color  to **R=124 G=99 B=49** and drag that **Alpha** slider to **40%**. Return to the **Effects** pane and simply tap the cogwheel button of this second **Fill**. Tap the **Blend Mode** command and select **Multiply** from that list.

##Step 8
Make sure that your gradient filled shapes stays selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** pane and simply check the checkbox that stand for the existing **Inner Shadow** to activate it. 

Enter -**1** in the **Y** box and **0** in the other two boxes and then tap the color well of this  effect. Set the color to  **R=255 G=255 B=255** (white) and drag that **Alpha** slider to **80%**. Return to the **Effects** pane, tap the cogwheel button of this  **Inner Shadow** effect and select the **Soft Light** blend mode.

##Step 9

Now, you will need a grid every **1 px**. This simply means that you need to return to the **Grid Settings** pane and enter **1 px** in both  **Spacing** boxes. 

Go to your **Toolbar** and set the **Fill** color to black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**). Using the **Rectangle Tool**, create a **130 x 1 px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the following image. 

Make sure that this thin shape stays selected and add eight copies in the same place. Select these new shapes one by one and then  tap and hold with a second finger while dragging to easily move your selection on only one axis (horizontally or vertically). 

Move your copies one under the other in a perfectly aligned column. When you get to the last copy, drag it to the bottom and place it exactly as shown in the second image.

##Step 10

Pick the **Path Selection Tool** and activate the **Add to Selection** mode. Select all your black rectangles, go to the **Align**  pane from the **Properties** panel and tap that  **Vertically** command to get an even amount of space  between your selected rectangles.

##Step 11

Make sure that all your thin rectangles are still selected, go to the **Combine** pane and tap that **Make** command. This will unite your black shapes into one compound path that can be selected, moved or edited way easier.

##Step 12

Make sure that your compound path is still selected and go to the **Effects** pane. First, lower the **Opacity** to **70%** and then tap the cogwheel button of that **Fill** and change the **Blend Mode** to **Soft Light**.
