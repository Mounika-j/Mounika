In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a small notebook icon in  Graphic for iPad. 

For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create the main shapes using basic tools and vector shape building techniques. Next, you will learn two techniques that can be used to perfectly align your shapes and paths to the pixel grid. 

Taking full advantage of the Effects pane, you will learn how to add smooth shading and sleek highlights for your objects. Finally, you will learn how to add and adjust linear or radial gradients.





##Step 1

From the **Documents Browser**, tap the plus button at the top-left corner of the **Titlebar** and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. Go to the **Canvas** pane, set the **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and make sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled. When this setting is enabled, stroked objects are offset slightly to ensure that the stroke is drawn aligned to the pixel grid which guarantees a crisp look.

Next, you need to setup the document grid. Tap again that **Settings** icon and switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open that **Grid Settings** pane, enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and   notice that by default the **Fill** color is set to white while the **Line** color is set to black. Tap the **Fill** color well and set its color to **R=74 G=196 B=237** and then tap the **Line** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this  will simply make your **Line** invisible. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, focus on the newly opened **Tool Options** pane and drag that  **Radius** slider to **5**. Move to yor canvas and  create a **130 x 130 px** shape - the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.

Make sure that this blue shape stays selected, focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and simply tap that middle icon to open the panel. Go to the **Arrange** pane and simply tap the **Align Horizontal** and **Align Vertical** buttons which will bring your rounded square in the center of the canvas.

##Step 3

Make sure that your blue shape is still selected, focus on the left side of your **Titlebar** and tap that paperclip icon to open the **Edit** pane. First, tap the **Copy** command and then tap that **Paste in Place** command to easily create a copy of your selected shape in the same place. 

Move to  your **Toolbar** and simply replace the existing **Fill** color with **R=1 G=173 B=14**. Pick the **Rectangle Tool** and  move to your canvas. Create a **130 x 100 px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the first image. Once again, the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will come in handy. 

Switch to the **Path Selection Tool**, focus on the  **Tool Options** pane and activate the **Add to Selection** mode. Select the copy of your blue shape along with that green rectangle, go to the **Combine** pane and simply tap that  **Intersect** command.

##Step 4

Make sure that the shape made in the previous step stays selected, focus on the right side of your **Titlebar** and tap the leftmost icon.

Move to the **Effects** pane and simply tap the color well of the existing **Fill**. Tap the **Gradient Fill** and the **Linear** buttons, set the **Angle** to -**90 degrees,** and then move to the gradient color stops. Select the left one and set its color to **R=255 G=240 B=190** and then select the right one and se its color to **R=235 G=210 B=160**. Keep focusing on this  gradient and simply tap on the gradient bar to add a new gradient color stop. Select it, set the color to **R=255 G=230 B=180** and then drag it to the left until the **Location** tooltip shows **10%**. Using the same technique, add a fourth gradient color stop. Set its color to **R=255 G=220 B=170** and drag it to **60%**.

##Step 5

Make sure that your gradient filled shape stays selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** pane and add a second **Fill** using the plus button from the bottom, right corner of your pane. 

Tap on its right side handle to drag this new **Fill** below the existing one and then tap its color well. Tap the **Gradient Fill** and the **Linear** buttons, set the **Angle** to -**90 degrees**, and then  move to the gradient color stops. Select the left one, move it to **80%**, replace the existing color with to **R=255 G=230 B=180** and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**. Move to the right gradient color stop, set the color  to **R=124 G=99 B=49** and drag that **Alpha** slider to **40%**. Return to the **Effects** pane and simply tap the cogwheel button of the **Fill** added in this step. Tap the **Blend Mode** command, select **Multiply** from that list, and then tap the **Done** button.

##Step 6

Make sure that your gradient filled shapes stays selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** pane and simply check the checkbox that stand for the existing **Inner Shadow** to activate it.

##Step 7

Now, you will need a grid every **1 px**. This simply means that you need to return to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** pane and enter **1 px** in both  **Spacing** boxes. 

Go to your **Toolbar** and set the **Fill** color to black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**). Using the **Rectangle Tool**, create a **130 x 1 px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the following image. 

Make sure that this thin shape stays selected and add eight copies in the same place. Select these new shapes one by one and then  tap and hold with a second finger while dragging to easily move your selection on only one axis (horizontally or vertically). 

Move your copies one under the other in a perfectly aligned column. When you get to the last copy, drag it to the bottom and place it exactly as shown in the second image.
