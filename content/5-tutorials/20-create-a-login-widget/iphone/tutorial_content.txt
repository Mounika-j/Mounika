In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a login widget in  Graphic for iPhone. 

For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create two, tiny icons using basic vector shape building techniques along with the Snap to Grid feature. Moving on, you will learn to create the main shapes and how to stylize them using the Effects pane. 

Finally, you will learn how to add some simple text and how to  stylize it. 





##Step 1

Start by tapping the   plus button from the top-left corner of your screen to create a new document. Tap the **Create Document** button and then choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar**, tap that ruler icon to open the **Properties** panel and then tap the **Canvas** pane. Set both **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and be sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled. When  this setting is enabled, stroked objects are offset slightly to ensure that the  stroke is drawn aligned to the pixel grid which guarantees a crisp look.

Re-open the **Properties** panel and this time tap the **Grid** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open the **Grid Settings** pane, enter **1 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and   notice that by default the **Fill** color is set to white while the **Line** color is set to black. Tap the **Fill** color well and set its color to black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**) and then tap the **Line** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this  will simply make your line invisible. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, focus on the newly opened tool pane and drag the  **Radius** slider to **5**. Move to yor canvas and simply create an **8 x 11 px** shape - the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.

Return to your Toolbar and replace the existing **Fill** color with **R=135 G=0 B=2**. Pick the **Rectangle Tool**, create an **8 x 4 px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the following image.

This simply means that you need to return to the **Grid** pane from the **Properties** panel, open that **Grid Settings** pane and enter **10 px** in both **Spacing** boxes. 

Set the **Fill** color to **R=40 G=42 B=44** and pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**. Set the  **Radius** to **5** and then create a **200 px** rounded square.
