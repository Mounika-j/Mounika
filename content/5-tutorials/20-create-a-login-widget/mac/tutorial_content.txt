In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a login widget in  Graphic for Mac. 

For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create two, tiny icons using basic vector shape building techniques along with the Snap to Grid feature. Moving on, you will learn to create the main shapes and how to stylize them using the Effects pane. 

Finally, you will learn how to add some simple text and how to  stylize it. 





##Step 1

Go to **File &gt; New (Command + N)** to bring up the **New Document** window. Select the **Grid** document style, set the document units to **pixels**, and set the document dimensions to **600** pixels wide by **600** pixels high.

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. If the **Properties** panel is not currently visible, you can easily open it using the ruler icon that lies above the **Layers** panel. Change the grid **X Spacing** and **Y Spacing** to **1**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0** and enable **Snap to Grid (Command + Shift + ')**.

Keep in mind that you can quickly enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature using the  **Command +  '** and  **Command + Shift + '** keyboard shortcuts.

##Step 2

Focus on the Toolbar and  notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the stroke color is set to black. Click  the **Fill** color well and set it to **R=0 G=0 B=0** (black) and then click the **Stroke** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this will simply make your stroke invisible. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)**, focus on your Tool Options bar and set the **Corner Radius** to **5 pt**. Move to your canvas and  create an **8 x 11 px** shape- the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work. 

Switch to the **Rectangle Tool (M)**, create an **8 x 4 px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the second image.
