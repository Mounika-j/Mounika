In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a login widget in  Graphic for iPad.
 
For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create two, tiny icons using basic vector shape building techniques along with the Snap to Grid feature. Moving on, you will learn to create the main shapes and how to stylize them using the Effects pane. 

Finally, you will learn how to add some simple text and how to  stylize it. 





##Step 1

From the **Documents Browser**, tap the plus button at the top-left corner of the **Titlebar** and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. Go to the **Canvas** pane, set the **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and make sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled. When  this setting is enabled, stroked objects are offset slightly to ensure that the  stroke is drawn aligned to the pixel grid which guarantees a crisp look.

Next, you need to setup the document grid. Tap again that **Settings** icon and switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open that **Grid Settings** pane, enter **1 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and   notice that by default the **Fill** color is set to white while the **Line** color is set to black. Tap the **Fill** color well and set its color to black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**) and then tap the **Line** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this  will simply make your line invisible. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, focus on the newly opened tool pane and drag the  **Radius** slider to **5**. Move to yor canvas and simply create an **8 x 11 px** shape - the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work. 

Switch to the **Rectangle Tool**, create an **8 x 4 px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the second image.

##Step 5

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, set the  **Radius** to **2 px** and create an **8 x 7px** shape. Using the same tool, create a **4 x 8 px** shape and place it as shown in the second image.
 
Make sure that this second rounded rectangle stays selected, go to the right side of your Titlebar and tap the leftmost icon. Focus on the **Appearance** pane and  tap the color well that stands for the **Fill**. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** to make it invisible and then go to the **Stroke**. Set the **Weight** to **2 pt** and then tap the color well that stands for the **Stroke**. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **100%** and be sure that the the color is set to black.

##Step 7

Focus on the right side of your Titlebar and simply tap the rightmost icon to open the **Layers** panel. Tap  the name of the existing layer and simply rename it &quot;_Icon_s&quot;. Keep focusing on the **Layers** panel and simply tap the plus icon that lies in the top, right corner of the panel to add a second layer. Make sure that this new layer stays selected and then close the **Layers** panel. 

For the following steps  you will need a grid every **10 px**.  This simply means that you need to return to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** pane,  open the **Grid Settings**  pane and enter **10 px** in both **Spacing** boxes. 

Focus on your Toolbar, be sure that the **Line** is invisible and set the **Fill** color to **R=40 G=42 B=44** . Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, set the  **Radius** to **5** and then create a **200 px** rounded square.

Tap  **Blend Mode** from the newly opened context menu, select  **Soft Light** from that list, and then tap that **Done** button.
