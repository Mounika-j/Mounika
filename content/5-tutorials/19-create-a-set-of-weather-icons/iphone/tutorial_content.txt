In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a set of flat weather icons in  Graphic for iPhone. 

For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create a cloud shape using basic tools and vector shapes building techniques.Taking full advantage of the Snap to Grid feature and using some simple stroke techniques, you will learn to create most of the icons. 

Finally, you will learn how to create a flat background, how to center it and how to add a subtle shadow to your icons. 





##Step 1

Start by tapping the   plus button from the top-left corner of your screen to create a new document. Tap the **Create Document** button and then choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar**, tap that ruler icon to open the **Properties** panel and then tap the **Canvas** pane. Set both **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and be sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled. When  this setting is enabled, stroked objects are offset slightly to ensure that the  stroke is drawn aligned to the pixel grid which guarantees a crisp look.

Re-open the **Properties** panel and this time tap the **Grid** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open the **Grid Settings** pane, enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and   notice that by default the **Fill** color is set to white while the **Line** color is set to black. Tap the **Fill** color well and set its color to **R=74 G=196 B=237** and then tap the **Line** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this  will simply make your **Line** invisible. 

Pick the **Ellipse Tool**, move to your canvas and  create a **40 px** circle - the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.

##Step 3

Replace the existing **Fill** color with **R=225 G=200 B=0**, make sure that the **Ellipse Tool**  is still active, create a **60 px** circle and place it as shown in the first image. 

Replace that yellow from the **Fill** color with **R=44 G=164 B=15**, create a **30 px** circle and place it as shown in the second image. 

Switch to the **Rectangle Tool** and set the **Fill** color to black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**). Create a **60 x 20 px** rectangle and place it as shown in the third image.

##Step 4

Using the **Move Tool**, select all the shapes made so far, go to the **Combine** pane from the **Properties** panel and simply tap that **Union** button. You will end up with a  blue, cloud shape like the one shown in the second image. 

Make sure that this  shape stays selected and tap and hold to open that context menu. First, tap the **Copy** command, and then reopen that context menu and tap the **Paste** command to duplicate your cloud shape. Select the copy, drag it down and place it roughly as shown in  the second image.
