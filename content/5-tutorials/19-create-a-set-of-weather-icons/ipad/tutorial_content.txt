In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a set of flat weather icons in  Graphic for iPad. 

For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create a cloud shape using basic tools and vector shapes building techniques.Taking full advantage of the Snap to Grid feature and using some simple stroke techniques, you will learn to create most of the icons. 

Finally, you will learn how to create a flat background, how to center it and how to add a subtle shadow to your icons. 





##Step 1

From the **Documents Browser**, tap the plus button at the top-left corner of the **Titlebar** and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. Go to the **Canvas** pane, set the **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and make sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled. When  this setting is enabled, stroked objects are offset slightly to ensure that the  stroke is drawn aligned to the pixel grid which guarantees a crisp look.

Next, you need to setup the document grid. Tap again that **Settings** icon and switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open that **Grid Settings** pane, enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and   notice that by default the **Fill** color is set to white while the **Line** color is set to black. Tap the **Fill** color well and set its color to **R=74 G=196 B=237** and then tap the **Line** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this  will simply make your **Line** invisible. 

Pick the **Ellipse Tool**, move to your canvas and  create a **40 px** circle - the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.

##Step 3

Replace the existing **Fill** color with **R=225 G=200 B=0**, make sure that the **Ellipse Tool**  is still active, create a **60 px** circle and place it as shown in the first image. 

Replace that yellow from the **Fill** color with **R=44 G=164 B=15**, create a **30 px** circle and place it as shown in the second image. 

Switch to the **Rectangle Tool** and set the **Fill** color to black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**). Create a **60 x 20 px** rectangle and place it as shown in the third image.

##Step 4

Using the **Move Tool**, select all the shapes made so far, focus on the right side of your Titlebar and tap that middle icon. Move to the **Combine** pane and simply tap that **Union** button. You will end up with a  blue, cloud shape like the one shown in the second image. 

Make sure that this  shape is selected, focus on the left side of your Titlebar and tap that paperclip icon to open the **Edit** pane. Simply tap the **Copy** and the **Paste** buttons to duplicate your blue icon. Select the copy, drag it down and place it roughly as shown in  the second image.
