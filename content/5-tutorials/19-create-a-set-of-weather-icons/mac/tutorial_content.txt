In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a set of flat weather icons in  Graphic for Mac. 

For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create a cloud shape using basic tools and vector shapes building techniques.Taking full advantage of the Snap to Grid feature and using some simple stroke techniques, you will learn to create most of the icons. 

Finally, you will learn how to create a flat background, how to center it and how to add a subtle shadow to your icons. 





##Step 1

Go to **File &gt; New (Command + N)** to bring up the **New Document** window. Select the **Grid** document style, set the document units to **pixels**, and set the document dimensions to **600** pixels wide by **740** pixels high.

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. If the **Properties** panel is not currently visible, you can easily open it using the ruler icon that lies above the **Layers** panel. Change the grid **X Spacing** and **Y Spacing** to **5**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0** and enable **Snap to Grid (Command + Shift + ')**.

Keep in mind that you can quickly enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature using the  **Command +  '** and  **Command + Shift + '** keyboard shortcuts.

##Step 2

Focus on the Toolbar and  notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the stroke color is set to black. Click  the **Fill** color well and set it to **R=74 G=196 B=237** and then click the **Stroke** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this will simply make your **Stroke** invisible. 

Pick the **Ellipse Tool (O)**, move to your canvas and  create a **40 px** circle - the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.

##Step 3

Replace the existing **Fill** color with **R=225 G=200 B=0**, make sure that the **Ellipse Tool (O)** is still active, create a **60 px** circle and place it as shown in the first image. 

Replace that yellow from the **Fill** color with **R=44 G=164 B=15**, create a **30 px** circle and place it as shown in the second image. 

Switch to the **Rectangle Tool (M)** and set the **Fill** color to black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**). Create a **60 x 20 px** rectangle and place it as shown in the third image.

##Step 4

Using the **Move Tool (V)**, select all the shapes made so far, focus on the **Path Tools** pane from the **Properties** panel and simply click that **Union** button. You should end up with a simple, blue shape like the one shown in the second image. 

Make sure that your cloud icons is selected and duplicate it (**Command + C &gt; Command + V**). Select the copy, drag it down and place it roughly as shown in  the second image.

##Step 5

Return to your Toolbar, this time make sure that the **Fill**  is invisible and then set the **Stroke** color to black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**).

Focus on your bottom cloud shape and pick the **Ellipse Tool (O)**. Create a **40 px** circle and place it as shown in the following image. Make sure that this new shape stays selected and focus on the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel. If the **Appearance** panel is not currently visible, you can easily open it using the leftmost icon that lies above the **Layers** panel. Select the **Stroke**, drag that **Width** slider to **6 pt** and  set the **Position** to **Inside**.

##Step 6

Pick the **Pen Tool (P)** or the **Line Tool (L)**, create a **10 px**, vertical path and place it as shown in the following image. Make sure that this new path stays selected and focus on the **Stroke** pane from the **Appearance** panel. Drag **Line Weight** slider to **6 pt** and don't forget to check that **Round Cap** button.

##Step 7

Make sure that your vertical path is still selected, pick the **Rotate Tool (R)** and you will notice a small cross icon in the center of your selection, that's the reference point. Simply drag it in the center of that circle and then focus on the Tool Options bar. Set the **Angle** to **45 degrees** and then hit that **Copy** button seven times. In the end things should look like in the second image.
