In the following tutorial you will learn how to create an email subscribe field in  Graphic for iPad. 

For starters, you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create a tiny envelope icon using basic tools and vector shape building techniques. Using mostly the Rounded Rectangle Tool and the Effects pane, you will create the main pieces of your subscribe field. 

Finally, you will learn how to add some simple pieces of text and and how to stylize them. 





##Step 1

From the **Documents Browser**, tap the plus button at the top-left corner of the **Titlebar** and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. Go to the **Canvas** pane, set the **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and make sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled. When  this setting is enabled, stroked objects are offset slightly to ensure that the  stroke is drawn aligned to the pixel grid which guarantees a crisp look.

Next, you need to setup the document grid. Tap again that **Settings** icon and switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open that **Grid Settings** pane, enter **1 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and   notice that by default the **Fill** color is set to white while the **Line** color is set to black. Tap the **Fill** color well and set its color to **R=50 G=50 B=55** and then tap the **Line** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this  will simply make your line invisible. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, focus on the newly opened **Tool Options** pane and drag the  **Radius** slider to **2**. Move to yor canvas and simply create a **16 x 12 px** shape - the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.

##Step 3

Using the **Pen Tool** or the **Line Tool**, create a **16 px**, horizontal path and place it exactly as shown in the following image. Make sure that this new path stays selected, focus on the right side of your Titlebar and tap the leftmost icon. Focus on the **Stroke** attributes, make sure that the **Width** is set to **1 pt** and then set the color to **R=255 G=201 B=0**. 

Make sure that your yellow path remains seelcted, pick the **Pen Tool**, focus on the newly opened **Tool Options** pane and activate the **Add Points** mode. Return to your  canvas and simply tap in the middle of your yellow path to add a new anchor point, as shown in the second image.
