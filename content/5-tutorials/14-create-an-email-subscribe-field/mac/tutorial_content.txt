In the following tutorial you will learn how to create an email subscribe field in  Graphic for Mac. 

For starters, you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create a tiny envelope icon using basic tools and vector shape building techniques. Using mostly the Rounded Rectangle Tool and the Effects pane, you will create the main pieces of your subscribe field. 

Finally, you will learn how to add some simple pieces of text and and how to stylize them. 





##Step 1

Go to **File &gt; New (Command + N)** to bring up the **New Document** window. Select the **Grid** document style, set the document units to **pixels**, and set the document dimensions to **600** pixels wide by **600** pixels high.

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. If the **Properties** panel is not currently visible, you can easily open it using the ruler icon that lies above the **Layers** panel. Change the grid **X Spacing** and **Y Spacing** to **1**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0** and enable **Snap to Grid (Command + Shift + ')**.

Keep in mind that you can quickly enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature using the  **Command +  '** and  **Command + Shift + '** keyboard shortcuts.

##Step 2

Focus on the Toolbar and  notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the stroke color is set to black. Click  the **Fill** color well and set it to **R=50 G=50 B=55** and then click the **Stroke** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this will simply make your stroke invisible. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)**, focus on your **Tool Options** bar and set the **Corner Radius** to **2 pt**. Move to your canvas and  create a **16 x 12 px** shape- the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.

##Step 3

Using the **Pen Tool (P)** or the **Line Tool (L)**, create a **16 px**, horizontal path and place it exactly as shown in the following image. Make sure that this new path stays selected and focus on the **Stroke** pane from the **Appearance** pane. If the **Appearance** pane is not currently visible, you can easily open it using the leftmost icon that lies above the **Layers** panel. Set the color to **R=255 G=201 B=0** and make sure that the **Line Weight**  slider is set to **1 pt**. 

Make sure that the  **Pen Tool (T)** is  still selected, focus on the **Tool Options** bar and activate the **Add Points** mode. Return to your  canvas, make sure that your yellow path is still selected and simply click in the middle to add a new anchor point as shown in the second image. 

Reselect your entire yellow path using the **Move Tool (V)** and duplicate it (**Command + C &gt; Command + V**). Select the copy and place it exactly as shown in the third image.

##Step 4

Pick the **Path Selection Tool (A)** and  focus on your top, yellow path. Select the middle anchor point and drag it **6 px** down. 

Move to your bottom, yellow path, select the middle anchor point and drag it **7 px** up. In the end things should look like in the second image.

##Step 5

Reselect both yellow paths, go to the **Path Tools** pane of the **Properties** panel and simply click that **Outline Stroke** button.

##Step 6

Select your top yellow shape and make a copy in the same place (**Command + C &gt; Command + Shift + V**). 

Select this fresh copy along with the bottom, yellow shape and click the **Subtract** button from the **Path Tools** pane. You will end up with the three yellow shapes highlighted in the second image.

##Step 9

For the next steps you will need a grid every **10 px**. This simply means that you need to return to the **Grid**  pane from the **Properties** panel and enter **10 px** in both  **Spacing** boxes. Get back  to your **Toolbar**, make sure that the **Stroke** is invisible and then set the **Fill** color to **R=60 G=60 B=65**. 

Pick the **Rectangle Tool (M)** and  create a **600 px** square. Make sure that this new shape stays selected, focus on the **Alignment** pane from the **Properties** panel and  click the **Horizontal Centers** and **Vertical Centers** buttons. This will simply  bring your square in the center of the canvas.

##Step 10
Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)**, focus on your **Tool Options** bar and drag that **Corner Radius** slider to **5 pt**. Move to your canvas and create a **300 x 70px** shape. 

Make sure that this new shape stays selected, focus on the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel and select the existing **Fill**. Select **Linear Gradient** from the **Type** drop-down menu, set the angle to **90 degrees** then move to the gradient sliders. Select the left one and set its color to **R=40 G=40 B=45** and then select the right one and set its color to **R=45 G=45 B=50**.

##Step 11

Change the **Blend Mode** to **Soft Light** and then  click the color well that stands for this effect. Replace the existing color with black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**) and drag that **Alpha** slider to **25%**.
