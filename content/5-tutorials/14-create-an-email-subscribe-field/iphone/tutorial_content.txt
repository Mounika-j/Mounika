In the following tutorial you will learn how to create an email subscribe field in  Graphic for iPhone. 

For starters, you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create a tiny envelope icon using basic tools and vector shape building techniques. Using mostly the Rounded Rectangle Tool and the Effects pane, you will create the main pieces of your subscribe field. 

Finally, you will learn how to add some simple pieces of text and and how to stylize them. 





##Step 1

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and   notice that by default the **Fill** color is set to white while the **Line** color is set to black. Tap the **Fill** color well and set its color to **R=50 G=50 B=55** and then tap the **Line** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this  will simply make your line invisible.
