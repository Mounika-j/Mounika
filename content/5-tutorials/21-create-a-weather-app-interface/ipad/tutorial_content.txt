In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a weather app interface in  Graphic for iPad.
 
For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create the background image. Taking full advantage of the grid and the Snap to Grid feature, you will learn how to create the main shapes and the subtle dividers. Using the Effects pane and some basic blending techniques, you will learn how to add color, shading and highlights for your shapes. 

Finally, you will learn how to add a bunch of text and how to stylize it. 





##Step 1

From the **Documents Browser**, tap the plus button at the top-left corner of the **Tool Options bar** and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Tool Options bar** and tap the **Settings** icon. Go to the **Canvas** pane, set the **Width** to **750 px** and the **Height** to **1334 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and make sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled. When this setting is enabled, stroked objects  are offset slightly to&nbsp;ensure that the stroke is drawn aligned to&nbsp;the  pixel grid which guarantees a crisp look.

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** pane, make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open that **Grid Settings** pane, enter **1 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2


Focus on the **Toolbar** and notice that by default the **Fill** color is set to white while the **Line** color is set to black. Tap the **Fill** color well and set its color to **R=0 G=124 B=215** and then tap the **Line** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this  will simply make your line invisible. 

Pick the **Rectangle Tool**, create a **750 x 1334 px** shape and make sure that it covers your entire canvas - the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.

##Step 3

Now, you  need to save [this image (the L version)](http://pixabay.com/en/yellow-orange-cloud-clouds-sunset-66010/) inside your Photos. Focus on your Toolbar, tap the **Photos Tool** and simply add the image saved a few moments ago. 

Make sure that it stays selected and tap that rectangular icon from the right side of your Tool Options bar. Focus on the **Arrange** pane and simply drag that **Order** slider to the left which will send your image in the back.

##Step 4

Make sure that your image is still selected, focus on the right side of your Tool Options bar and tap that ruler icon to open the **Geometry** panel. 

Check the **Constrain width and height** button (highlighted in the following image) and then  enter **1334 px** in the **Height** box. This will simply resize your image without messing the proportions. Keep focusing on this pane and move to the **Position** section. Enter **-740 px** in the **X** box and **0** in the **Y** box and your image should end up positioned as shown in the following image.

##Step 5

Reselect your blue rectangle along with that image, focus on the **Combine** pane and simply tap that **Intersect** command.  In the end things should look like in the second image.

Tap the rightmost icon from your Tool Options bar to open the **Layers** panel. Open the existing layer and simply lock your image to make sure that you won't accidentally select/move it in the next steps.

##Step 6

For the following steps you will need a grid every **5 px**. Simply go to **Grid and Rulers** pane,  open the **Grid Settings**  and enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes.  Return to your Toolbar, make sure that the **Line** is invisible and then set the **Fill** color to **R=0 G=152 B=245**. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, focus on the newly opened tool pane and drag the  **Radius** slider to **10**. Move to your canvas, create a **720 x 450 px** shape and place it as shown in the following image.

##Step 7

Make sure that the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**  is still active, create a **170 x 290 px** shape and place it as shown in the following image.

##Step 8

Make sure that your smaller rounded rectangle is still selected and tap that paperclip icon from your **Titlebar** to open the **Edit** pane. Use the **Copy** and **Paste in Place** commands to add three copies of your selection in the same place. 

Select the top copy and drag it **540 px** to the right. Drag and hold, and then tap and hold with a second finger to easily move your selection on only one axis (horizontally or vertically). This should leave a **20 px** gap between the edge of your shape and the edge of the canvas. 

Using the **Move Tool**, select all four rounded rectangles. Open the **Arrange** pane and tap that **Distribute Horizontally** command. In the end, your rounded rectangles should be perfectly aligned, as shown in the following image.

##Step 9

Reselect  the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, create a **720 x 170 px** shape and place it as shown in the following image.

##Step 10

Use the  **Copy** and **Paste** commands from that **Edit** pane to multiply the rounded rectangle made in the previous step and place the copies as shown in the following image. 

(image: weatherAppInterfaceiPad10.jpg)



##Step 11

For the following steps you will need a grid every **1 px**. Re-open the **Grid Settings** pane and enter **1 px** in both  **Spacing** boxes. Get back to your Toolbar, make sure that the **Stroke** is invisible and then set the **Fill** color to black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**). 

Focus on your left, **170 x 290** rounded rectangle. Using the **Rectangle  Tool**, create a **166 x 2 px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the following image.

##Step 12

Multiply that black rectangle and place the copies as shown in the following image. Make sure that all these shapes are perfectly aligned.

##Step 13

Return to your Toolbar, make sure that the **Stroke** is still invisible and then set the **Fill** color to **R=255 G=185 B=0**. 

Focus on your top, **720 x 170** rounded rectangle. Using the **Rectangle  Tool**, create two, **2 x 166 px** shapes  and place them  exactly as shown in the following image.

##Step 15

Select the top, rounded rectangle, focus on the right side of your Titlebar and tap the leftmost icon. Move to the **Effects** pane, tap the color well that stands for the existing **Fill**, drag the **Alpha** slider to **20%** and replace the existing color with a simple white (**R=255 G=255 B=255**).

##Step 17

Make sure that your top, rounded rectangle stays selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** pane and add a second **Stroke** using the plus button located in the bottom, right corner of your pane. 

Select this new **Stroke** and make sure that it lies below the other one. Drag the **Width** slider to **2 pt**,  select the **Outside Alignment** button and then tap the color well that stands for this new **Stroke**. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **15%** and replace the existing color with a simple black. 

Return to the **Effects** pane and tap the cogwheel icon that stands for your new **Stroke**. Tap the **Blend Mode** command, select the **Soft Light** blend mode then tap that **Done** button. In the end things should look like in the following image.

Enter **2** in the **Y** box and **0** in the other two boxes, change the **Blend Mode** to **Soft Light** and then tap the color well that stands for this effect. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **30%** and replace the existing color with white. Don't forget to drag this effect right below the **Fill**.

##Step 26

Now, you need this [Set of Flat Weather Icons](http://graphic.com/tutorials/create-a-set-of-weather-icons?format=ipad). Feel free to follow that tutorial and create your own icons or simply copy the icons from the Graphic file that can be downloaded in the finale of the tutorial. Paste all those icons inside your document and place them roughly as shown in the following image.

##Step 27

Duplicate one of those weather icons, double its size and place it as shown in the following image.

##Step 28

Pick  the **Text Tool** and simply  double tap inside that new field. Set the color to white, select the **Arial Rounded MT** font and make it **Bold**. Drag the  font size slider to **75** and then simply add that tiny  &quot;_21°_&quot; piece of text. Place it as shown in the following image and make sure that it stays selected. 

Move to the **Effects** pane, activate the existing **Drop Shadow** and enter the attributes shown in the following image. 

(image: weatherAppInterfaceiPad28.jpg)



##Step 29

 Use that same ****font, but decrease the **Size** to **50 pt**. Add the &quot;_01:23_&quot; piece of text, place it as shown in the following image and make sure that it stays selected. Move to the **Effects** pane, activate the existing **Drop Shadow** and enter the attributes shown in the following image.
