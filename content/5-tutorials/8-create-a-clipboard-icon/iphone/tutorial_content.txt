In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a clipboard icon in  Graphic for iPhone.
 
For starters you will learn how to set up a simple grid and how to create the main shapes using the Rounded Rectangle Tool. Using an image fill, a bunch of effects and some basic blending techniques you will learn how to create the wooden board with all its shading and highlights. Using mostly simple shapes, basic vector shape building techniques and the Effects pane you will learn how to create the remaining pieces of your icon. 





##Step 1

Start by tapping the   plus button from the top-left corner of your screen to create a new document. Tap the **Create Document** button and then choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar**, tap that ruler icon to open the **Properties** panel and then tap the **Canvas** pane. Set both **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and be sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled. When this setting is enabled, stroked objects are offset slightly to ensure that the stroke is drawn aligned to the pixel grid which guarantees a crisp look.

Re-open the **Properties** panel and this time tap the **Grid** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open the **Grid Settings** pane and enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and   notice that by default the **Fill** color is set to white while the **Line** color is set to black. Tap the **Fill** color well and set its color to **R=215 G=205 B=175** and then tap the **Line** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this  will simply make your line invisible. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, focus on the newly opened **Tool Options** pane and drag the  **Radius** slider to **10**. Move to yor canvas and simply create a **180 x 245 px** shape - the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.

##Step 3

Make sure that your shape stays selected, focus on the right side of your Titlebar and tap the leftmost icon to open the **Appearance** panel. Go to the **Effects** pane and  add a second **Fill** using the plus button located in the top, right corner of your pane. Tap the color well that stands for this new **Fill** and replace the existing color with **R=254 G=128 B=128**. Make sure that this pink **Fill** lies below that other **Fill**.

##Step 4

For this step you  need to save [this free image](http://pixabay.com/en/wood-mahogany-texture-364694/) inside your Photos. Make sure that your rounded rectangle is still selected, go to the **Image** pane from the **Appearance** panel and  simply add the image saved a few moments ago. 

You'll  probably notice that the image doesn't cover your entire shape, but this  issue can be solved pretty fast. Activate the **Move Tool**, make sure that your rounded rectangle is still selected and  tap it once. Drag that **Image** slider slightly to the right until you can tell that your image covers the entire shape. Once you're done, simply tap outside your shape.
