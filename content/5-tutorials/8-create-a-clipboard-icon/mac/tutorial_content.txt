In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a clipboard icon in  Graphic for Mac. 

For starters you will learn how to set up a simple grid and how to create the main shapes using the Rounded Rectangle Tool. Using an image fill, a bunch of effects and some basic blending techniques you will learn how to create the wooden board with all its shading and highlights. Using mostly simple shapes, basic vector shape building techniques and the Effects pane you will learn how to create the remaining pieces of your icon. 





##Step 1

Go to **File &gt; New (Command + N)** to bring up the **New Document** window. Select the **Grid** document style, set the document units to **pixels**, and set the document dimensions to **600** pixels wide by **600** pixels high.

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. If the **Properties** panel is not currently visible, you can easily open it using the ruler icon that lies above the **Layers** panel. Change the grid **X Spacing** and **Y Spacing** to **5**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0** and enable **Snap to Grid (Command + Shift + ')**.

Keep in mind that you can quickly enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature using the  **Command +  '** and  **Command + Shift + '** keyboard shortcuts.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and notice that by default the **Fill** color is set to white while the **Stroke** color is set to black. Click  the **Fill** color well and set it to **R=215 G=205 B=175** and then click on the **Stroke** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this should simply make your stroke invisible. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (M)**, focus on the **Tool Options** bar and drag that **Corner Radius** slider to **10 pt**. Move to your canvas and simply create a **180 x 245 px** shape - the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.

##Step 3

Now, you need to download [this free imag](http://pixabay.com/en/wood-mahogany-texture-364694/). Make sure that your shape is still selected, focus on the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel and add a second **Fill** using the plus button located in the bottom, left corner of your panel. If the **Appearance** panel is not currently visible, you can easily open it using the leftmost icon that lies above the **Layers** panel. 

Select your new **Fill**, select **Image** from the **Type** drop-down menu and simply add the image downloaded a few moments ago. Go to the **Blend** drop-down menu and select **Multiply** and then drag that **Scale** slider to around **140%**. In the end your rounded rectangle should look like in the following image.
