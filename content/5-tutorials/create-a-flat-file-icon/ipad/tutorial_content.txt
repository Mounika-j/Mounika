In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a flat file icon in Graphic for iPad. 

For starters you'll learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create the main shapes using basic tools and vector shape building techniques. You''ll learn how to ease your work using compound paths and how to add subtle shading and highlights using the Effects pane. 

Finally, you'll learn the use of the Align strokes to pixel grid feature. 





##Step 1

From the **Documents Browser**, tap the plus button at the top-left corner of the **Titlebar** and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. In the **Canvas** pane set the **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base units, and verify that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled, for now.

Next, let's set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** pane in the **Settings** popover. Be sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Finally,  open the **Grid Spacing** pane, enter **10 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar**, tap on the fill color well and replace the existing color  with **R=246 G=240 B=213** and then tap  the line color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**. This will simply make your line invisible. 
Pick the **Round Rectangle Tool**, focus on the newly opened tool pane and drag the **Radius** slider to **5**. Move to your canvas and simply create an **120 x 165 px** rounded rectangle. The grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work. 

Make sure that your  shape stays selected, focus on the left side of the Titlebar and simply tap that paperclip icon to open the **Edit** pane. First, tap the **Copy** button and then tap the **Paste in Place** button which will create  a copy of your rounded rectangle in the same location.

##Step 3

Replace the existing fill color with **R=74 G=195 B=237** and pick the **Rectangle Tool**. 

Create a **45 px** square and place it exactly as shown in the first image. Switch to the **Pen Tool**, focus on the newly opened tool pane and activate the **Delete Point** mode. Focus on the bottom side of your blue shape and simply tap  the left anchor point to remove it. In the end your blue square should turn into a simple triangle as shown in the second image.

##Step 23

Alternatively, you can try a different set of colors for your final icon. Select the highlighted shapes one by one and simply replace the existing colors with the ones shown in the following image.

##Step 24

Finally, if you choose to export your design as an image you will notice that those horizontal and vertical lines end up looking pretty blurry. This  happens because the strokes applies for those lines are not perfectly aligned to the pixels grid.  To fix this issue, just go to the **Canvas** pane and activate that **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature.
