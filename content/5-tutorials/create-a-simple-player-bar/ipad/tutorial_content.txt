In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a simple player bar in Graphic for iPad. 

For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create  the main shape using the Rounded Rectangle Tool, a linear gradient and several effects. Using similar tools and techniques you will create the sound bar and the seek bar. 

Finally, you'll learn how to make two simple icons and two subtle separators. 





##Step 1

For this tutorial we'll create a new **600 x 600 pixel** document. From the **Documents Browser**, tap the plus button at the top-right corner of the **Titlebar** and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. Go to the **Canvas** panel, set the **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and make sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is enabled. The **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature ensures that all shapes which are aligned to the pixel grid will have solid, crisp strokes.

Next, you need to adjust your document's grid so switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** panel. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Open the **Grid Settings** pane, enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in that one **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and you will notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the stroke color is set to black. Tap the fill color wheel and replace the existing color with **R=24 G=169 B=250** and then  tap  the stroke color wheel and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**, which will simply make the stroke invisible. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, focus on the newly opened tool pane and drag the  **Radius** slider to **2**. Move to your canvas and create a **370 x 35 px** shape.

##Step 3

Make sure that your rounded rectangle stays selected, focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the leftmost icon.
 
Move to the **Effects** panel and tap the color wheel that stands for the existing **Fill**. Tap the **Gradient Fill** and **Linear** buttons, set the **Angle** to **-90 degrees** and then move to the gradient sliders. Select the left one and replace the existing color with **R=21 G=23 B=22** and then select the right one and replace the existing color with **R=60 G=63 B=62**.

##Step 4

Make sure that your rounded rectangle stays selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** panel and check the little box that stands for the existing **Drop Shadow** to activate it.
 
Enter **1** in the **Y** box and **0** in the other two boxes and then tap the color wheel that stands for your **Drop Shadow**. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **10%** and make sure that the color is set to black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**).

##Step 8
Make sure that your rounded rectangle is still selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** panel and add a second **Inner Shadow** using the plus button located in the bottom, right corner of your panel. 

Select this new effect, enter **2** in the **Y** box and **0** in the other two boxes and then tap the color wheel that stands for this effect. Drag the **Alpha** slider at **20%** and replace the existing color with white (**R=255 G=255 B=255**). 

Return to the **Effects** pane and tap the cogwheel icon that stands for your new **Inner Shadow**. Go to **Blend Mode**, select the **Soft Light** blend mode and then tap the **Done** button.

##Step 14

Now, you will need a grid every  **1 px** which simply means that you need to return to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** panel,  open the **Grid Settings** pane and enter **1 px** inside both **Spacing** boxes.    

Get back to your **Toolbar**, make sure that the stroke is invisible and then set the fill color to **R=0 G=174 B=15**. Using the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, create a **15 x 3 px** shape and place it as shown in the following image. Make sure that this green shape stays selected and focus on the **Effects** panel. Activate the existing **Inner Shadow** and enter the attributes shown in the following image.

##Step 15

Return to your **Toolbar**, make sure that the stroke is still invisible and pick a random yellow for the fill. 

Using the **Rectangle Tool**, create a **4 x 5 px** shape and place it as shown in the following image.

##Step 16

Get back to your **Toolbar**, make sure that the stroke is invisible and pick a random blue for the fill. 

Pick the **Rectangle Tool**, create a **3 x 9 px** shape and place it as shown in the first image. Focus on the left side of this new shape and switch to the **Path Selection Tool**. Select the top anchor point and drag it **2 px** down and then select the bottom anchor point and drag it **2 px** up. In the end your blue rectangle should turn into a trapezoid as shown in the second image.

Get back to your **Toolbar**, make sure that the stroke is still invisible and then replace the existing fill color with a simple blue. 

Using the **Rectangle Tool**, create a **10 px** square and place it as shown in the first image. Focus on the right side of this new shape and switch to the **Path Selection Tool**. First, select the bottom anchor point and drag it **5 px** up and then select the top anchor point and remove it using the **X** button from the left side of your **Titlebar**. In the end your blue rectangle should turn into a simple triangle as shown in the second image

##Step 23


Move to your **Toolbar**, make sure that the stroke is still invisible and then set the fill color to **R=61 G=63 B=62**. 

Using the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, create a **160 x 3 px** shape and place it as shown in the first image. Return to your **Toolbar** and replace the existing fill color with **R=218 G=65 B=0**.

##Step 25

Get back to your **Toolbar**, this time make sure that the fill is invisible and then set the stroke color to **R=218 G=65 B=0**. 

Focus on your speaker icon and pick the **Line Tool**. Create a **15 px**, vertical path and place it as shown in the first image. Make sure that it stays selected and focus on the **Effects** panel. Drag the  **Width** slider to **1 pt** and check the **Round Cap** button. Get back to your vertical path and switch to the **Path Selection Tool**. Select the top anchor point and simply drag it **15 px** to the right as shown in the second image.
