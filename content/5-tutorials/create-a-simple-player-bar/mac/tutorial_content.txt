In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a simple player bar in Graphic for Mac. 

For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create  the main shape using the Rounded Rectangle Tool, a linear gradient and several effects. Using similar tools and techniques you will create the sound bar and the seek bar. 

Finally, you'll learn how to make two simple icons and two subtle separators. 





##Step 1

For this tutorial we'll create a new **600 x 600 pixel** document. Go to **File &gt; New** or hit the **Command + N** keyboard shortcut to bring up the **New Document** window. Select the **Grid** document style, select **pixels** for the document unit and then set the document dimensions to **600** pixels wide by **600** pixels high.

Next, you need to adjust  the document's grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. If the **Properties** pane is not currently visible, you can easily open it using the ruler icon that lies above the **Layers** panel. Change the grid **X Spacing** and **Y Spacing** to **5**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0** and then enable **Snap to Grid**. 

Keep in mind that you can quickly enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature using the  **Command +  '** and  **Command + Shift + '** keyboard shortcuts.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and you will notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the stroke color is set to black. Click  the fill color wheel and replace the existing color with **R=29 G=29 B=34** and then click the stroke color wheel and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**, which will simply make the stroke invisible.  

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)**, focus on the tool options bar and drag the **Corner Radius** slider to **10 pt**. Move to your canvas and create a **370 x 35 px** shape.

##Step 3

Make sure that your rounded rectangle stays selected, focus on the **Effect** pane from the **Appearance** panel and select the existing **Fill**. If the **Appearance** pane is not currently visible, you can click  the leftmost icon that lies above the **Layers** panel to show and hide this panel. 

Select **Linear Gradient** from the **Type** drop-down menu, set the **Angle** to **90 degrees** and then move to the gradient sliders. Select the left one and replace the existing color with **R=21 G=23 B=22** and then select the right one and replace the existing color with **R=60 G=63 B=62**.

##Step 4

Make sure that your rounded rectangle stays selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel and check the little box that stands for the existing **Drop Shadow** to activate it.

 Enter **1** in the **Y** box and **0** in the other two boxes and then click the color wheel that stands for your **Drop Shadow**. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **10%** and make sure that the color is set at black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**).

##Step 14

Now, you will need a grid every **1 px** which simply means that you need to return to the **Grid**  pane from the **Properties** panel and enter **1 px** in both  **Spacing** boxes. 

 Get back to your **Toolbar**, make sure that the stroke is invisible and then set the fill color to **R=0 G=174 B=15**. Using the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)**, create a **15 x 3 px** shape and place it as shown in the following image.
