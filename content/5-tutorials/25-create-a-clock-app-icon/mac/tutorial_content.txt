In the following tutorial, you will learn how to create a clock app icon in Picta Graphic for Mac. 

For starters, you will learn how to set up a simple grid and how to create a simple background. Taking full advatange of the Effects pane, you will learn how to add shading and subtle highlights for the main shape. 

Using some thin text along with some basic vector shape building techiques, you will learn how to create a simplified grid and a tiny bell icon. Finally, you will learn how to create the clock hands and how to easily adjust them using the Rotate Tool. 





##Step 1

For this tutorial we'll create a new **680 x 680 pixel** document. Go to **File &gt; New (Command + N)** to bring up the **New Document** panel. Select the **Grid** document style and set the document units to **pixels**. Set the document dimensions to **680** pixels wide by **680** pixels high and then click **Choose** to create your document.

Next, we'll adjust the document grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. You can easily open or close the **Properties** panel using that ruler icon. Change the **X** &amp; **Y Spacing** to **1**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0** and don't forget to enable **Snap to Grid**—all these features will make your work easier.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar**, click  the stroke color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**, which will simply make the stroke invisible. 

Pick the **Rectangle  Tool (M)**, focus on your canvas and create a **680 px** square. Holding the **Shift** key will make it a lot easier for you to create a perfect square.

Make sure that your square covers the entire canvas, keep it selected and go to the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel—click the leftmost inspector panel icon to open the **Appearance** panel whenever you want.Click the existing fill and replace the color with a linear gradient. Set the **Angle** to **135 degrees** and then move to the gradient color stops. Click the left one and set its color to **R=195 G=192 B=233**, and then click the right one and set its color to **R=241 G=240 B=255**.

##Step 3

Focus on the **Layers** panel for a moment. Double click the name of the existing layer and rename it &quot;_Bg_&quot;. Using the plus button from the bottom, left corner of the panel, add a second layer. Rename it &quot;_Frame_&quot; and make sure that it stays selected, as the new objects you are about to create will go here.

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)** and set the **Corner Radius** to **55 pt**. Create a **256 x 256 px** shape and fill it with the linear gradient shown below.
