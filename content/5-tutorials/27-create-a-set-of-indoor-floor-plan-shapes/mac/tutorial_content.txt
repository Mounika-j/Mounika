In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a set of indoor floor plan symbols and how to save them inside your shape library. 

For starters you will learn how to set up a simple grid and how to use the canvas scale settings. Moving on you will learn how to take full advantage of the Snap to Grid feature and how to work with basic tools.
 
To ease the work and to speed up your work process. you will learn how to easily save colors and styles and how to use them throughout the tutorial. You will learn how to create dotted or perfect paths and how to align, adjust or cut objects. 

Finally, you will learn how to create a new shape library, how to save your symbols and how to import or export existing shape libraries. 





##Step 1

For this tutorial we'll create a new **56 x 56 ft** document. Go to **File &gt; New** or hit the **Command + N** keyboard shortcut to bring up the **New Document** window. Select the **Grid** document style and select **inches** for the document unit. Set the document dimensions to **56** inches wide by **56** inches high, and then click **Choose** to create your document. 

We're about to create a ‘to-scale’ technical design using the canvas scale settings. First, you need to open the **Canvas** pane from the **Properties** panel – click that ruler icon to open or close the **Properties** panel whenever you want. Change the scale unit from inches to feet and set one inch to stands for three feet. The actual paper size of the document will not change, only the displayed values and units are adjusted by this setting. Once you're done, return to the canvas size and set the **Width** and **Height** of your document to **56 ft**.

Next, you need to adjust  the document's grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. Change the grid **X Spacing** and **Y Spacing** to **0.1**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0** and then enable the **Snap to Grid** feature. 

Keep in mind that you can quickly enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature using the  **Command +  '** and the  **Command + Shift + '** keyboard shortcuts.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and   notice that by default the **Fill** color is set to white while the **Stroke** color is set to black. Click  the **Stroke** color well and replace the existing color with **R=54 G=65 B=80** and then click the **Fill** color. Simply drag that **Alpha** slider to **0%** to  make your **Fill** invisible

 Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)**, focus on the **Tool Options** bar and drag the **Corner Radius** slider to **8 pt**. Move to your canvas and create a **2.6 x 2.6 ft** shape – the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work. Holding the **Shift** key while dragging will make it easier for you to create this rounded square. 
 
Make sure that this shape stays selected and go to the **Stroke** pane from the **Appearance** panel – click the leftmost inspector panel icon to open or close the **Appearance** panel whenever you want. Drag the **Line Weight** slider to **4 pt**, make sure that the **Position** is set to **Center** and don't forget to check the **Round Cap** and **Round Join** buttons. These two buttons won't change the look of your shape, but will help you later. 

You should also save the stroke color used for this shape as you are about to use it throughout the entire tutorial. Click the color well from the **Stroke** pane (or the **Stroke** color well from your **Toolbar**), switch from the **Color Picker**  to the **Color Palette**, and then click that plus button to add your active color to the existing set of colors.

##Step 3

Make sure that your rounded rectangle is still selected and open the **Styles** panel – click that paint roller icon to open or close the **Styles** panel whenever you want. Simply click that plus button from the bottom of the panel to save the attributes used for your selected shape. Using this style you will be able to quickly apply the appearance attributes of this rounded rectangle to other shapes.

##Step 25

Using the **Ellipse Tool (O)**, create a **1 x 0.7 ft** shape, place it as shown in the first image and apply your second style. Create two, **0.1 ft** circle, place them as shown in the first image and fill both shapes with your saved color. 

Add a third, **0.1 ft** circle, fill it with the same color and place it as shown in the third image. Select this tiny, new circle along with the oval shape made in the beginning of the step, go to the **Alignment** pane from the **Properties** panel and simply click the **Vertical Centers** command. 

(image: furnitureShapes25.jpg)



##Step 26

Using the **Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)**, create a **0.2 x 0.1 ft** shape, place it as shown in the first image and fill it with your color. Switch to the **Line Tool (L)**, create a **0.3 ft**, vertical path, place it as shown in the second image and simply apply your second style. 

Move to the **Layers** panel and duplicate your &quot;_sink 1_&quot; layer. Rename this group copy &quot;_sink 1 Large_&quot;. Select all the shapes from this newly added layer and drag them down, about as shown in the third image. 

(image: furnitureShapes26.jpg)



##Step 27

Make sure that your &quot;_Sink 1 Large_&quot; layer is still selected and focus on the main shape. Using the **Path Selection Tool (A)**, select the three anchor points highlighted in the first image and simply drag them **0.4 ft** down as shown in the second image. 

(image: furnitureShapes27.jpg)



##Step 28

Delete the oval shapes that lies inside your  &quot;_Sink 1 Large_&quot; layer and replace it with a **1 ft** circle as shown in the first image. Don't forget to apply the second style for this new shape.

 Focus on the top side of this circle and pick the **Path Selection Tool (A)**. Select that anchor point and simply drag it **0.1 ft** up as shown in the second image. 

(image: furnitureShapes28A.jpg)

Using the  tools, techniques and styles mentioned in the previous step you can create a variety of sink symbols as shown in the following image.

##Step 29

Using the same tool, techniques and styles mentioned in the previous step you can create pieces of a sofa and combine them to create bigger sofas.

(image: furnitureShapes29A.jpg)

Or, you can create pieces of a closet and combine them to create bigger closets.

(image: furnitureShapes29B.jpg)

Or, you can create any of the symbols shown below.

(image: furnitureShapes29C.jpg)



##Step 30

Finally, let's learn how to save your symbols inside a shape library. Open the **Shape Library** panel and click that settings button from the top, right corner. Go to **New Shape Library...** and the window with the attributes of your new shape library will open. Enter a name for your new shape library, pick a background color and then click the **OK** button. 

By default your new shape library will open. Keep in mind that you can easily switch between shape libraries using the drop-down menu from the top of the panel. 

(image: furnitureShapes30.jpg)



##Step 31

Make sure that your new shape library is active and focus on the shapes that lie inside your &quot;_shower 1_&quot; layer. Select this layer from the **Layers** panel. Pick the **Move Tool (V)** select all those shapes and **Group** them (**Command + G**). Simply click the plus button from the bottom, left corner of the **Shape Library** panel and your selected group will be immediately saved inside the active shape library. 

Your shape libraries and their content are  saved and can be used in any document. You can easily import or export  shape libraries and use them on different device. Click that settings icon from the **Shape Library** panel and use the **Import Shape Library** command or the **Export** command. 

Finally, feel free to add the rest of the symbols created so far. Select each layer and don't forget to **Group** the existing shapes and paths before you click that plus button.
