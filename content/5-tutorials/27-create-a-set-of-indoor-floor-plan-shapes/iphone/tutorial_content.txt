In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a set of indoor floor plan symbols and how to save them inside a shape library. 

For starters you will learn how to set up a simple grid and how to use the canvas scale settings. Moving on you will learn how to take full advantage of the Snap to Grid feature and how to work with basic tools. 

To ease the work and to speed up your process you will learn how to easily save colors and styles and how to use them throughout the tutorial. You will learn how to create dotted or perfect paths and how to align, adjust or cut objects. 

Finally, you will learn how to create a new shape library, how to save your symbols and how to import existing shape libraries. 





##Step 1

Tap the plus button from the top, left corner of the screen, tap the the **Create Document** button and then choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap that ruler icon to open the  **Properties** panel. Open the **Canvas** pane and go to the **Units &amp; Scale** pane. 

We're about to create a ‘to-scale’ technical design using the canvas scale settings. First, make sure that the **Base Unit** is set to inches and then move to the bottom of the pane. Change the **Display Unit** from inches to feet and set one inch to stands for three feet. The actual paper size of the document will not change, only the displayed values and units are adjusted by this setting.
 
Once you're done return to the **Canvas** pane and set the **Width** and **Height** of your canvas to **56 ft**.

Next, you need to adjust your document's grid. Re-open the **Properties** panel and this time go to the **Grid** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. 

Open the **Grid Settings** pane, enter **0.1 ft** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in that one **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and   notice that by default the **Fill** color is set to white while the **Line** color is set to black. Tap  the **Line** color well and replace the existing color with **R=54 G=65 B=80**, and then tap the **Fill** color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**, which will simply make the fill invisible. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, focus on that  **Tool Options** pane and drag the  **Radius** slider to **8**. Move to your canvas and create a **2.6 x 2.6 ft** shape - the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.

Make sure that your shape stays selected and focus on the right side of your **Titlebar**. Tap the leftmost icon to open the **Appearance** panel and then go to the **Effects** pane. Tap the existing **Stroke** to expand it, drag the **Width** slider to **4 pt** and then check the **Round Cap**, **Round Join** and **Center Alignment** buttons.

You should also save the stroke color used for this shape as you are about to use it throughout the entire tutorial. Simply tap the **Stroke** color well from the **Effects**  panel (or the **Line** color well from your **Toolbar**), switch to the **Color Palette**, and then  drag your active color to one of the palette slots.
