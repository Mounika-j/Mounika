In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a simple switch button in  Graphic for Mac. 

For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create the main shapes using the Ellipse Tool and then Rounded Rectangle Tool. Next, you'll learn how to work with linear gradients and how to add shading and highlights for your shapes using some of the effects available in the Effects pane.

 Finally, you''ll learn how to speed up your work using grouping techniques. 





##Step 1

Go to **File &gt; New (Command + N)** to bring up the **New Document** window. Select the **Grid** document style, set the document units to **pixels**, and set the document dimensions to **600** pixels wide by **600** pixels high.

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. If the **Properties** panel is not currently visible, you can easily open it using the ruler icon. Change the grid **X Spacing** and **Y Spacing** to **5**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0** and enable **Snap to Grid (Command + Shift + ')**.

Keep in mind that you can quickly enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature using the  **Command +  '** and  **Command + Shift + '** keyboard shortcuts.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and   notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the stroke color is set to black.
 
Click  the fill color well and set it to **R=0 G=152 B=245** and then click  the stroke color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this  will simply make the stroke invisible. Pick the **Rectangle Tool (M)**, focus on your canvas and create a **600 px** square. Holding the **Shift** key will make it a lot easier for you to create that perfect square.

##Step 3
