In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a simple switch button in  Graphic for iPad. 

For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create the main shapes using the Ellipse Tool and then Rounded Rectangle Tool. Next, you'll learn how to work with linear gradients and how to add shading and highlights for your shapes using some of the effects available in the Effects pane. 

Finally, you''ll learn how to speed up your work using grouping techniques. 





##Step 1

From the **Documents Browser**, tap the plus button at the top-left corner of the **Titlebar** and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. Go to the **Canvas** pane, set the **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and make sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled.

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open that **Grid Settings** pane, enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and  notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the line color is set to black. 

Tap the fill color well and set its color to **R=0 G=152 B=245** and then tap the line color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this will simply make your line invisible. Pick the **Rectangle  Tool**, focus on your canvas and create a **600 px** square - the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.
