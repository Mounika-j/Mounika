In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a detailed iPhone X illustration in Picta Graphic for Mac. 

For starters, you will learn how to set up a simple grid, how to create several basic shapes and how to easily place them in the center of your canvas. Taking full advantage of the Effects pane, you will learn how to stylize your shape. Using basic vector shape building techniques, you will learn how to add subtle shading and highlights for your shapes. 

You will learn how to work inside the Layers panel and how to ease your work using the Copy/Paste Style feature. Finally, you will learn how to create two flat icons and how to add some basic pieces of text. 





##Step 1

For this tutorial we'll create a **680 x 1120 px** document. Go to **File &gt; New (Command-N)** to bring up the **New Document** panel. Select the **Grid** document style and set the document units to **pixels**. Set the document dimensions to **680** pixels wide by **1120** pixels high and then click **Choose** to create your document. 

Next, we'll adjust the document grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. You can easily open or close the **Properties** panel using that ruler icon. Change the **X** &amp; **Y Spacing** to **1**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0** and don't forget to enable **Snap to Grid**—all these features will make your work easier.

Keep in mind that you can quickly enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature using the  **Command +  '** and the  **Command + Shift + '** keyboard shortcuts.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and click the **Stroke** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** which will simply make your stroke invisible. Click the **Fill** color well and replace the existing color with **R=255 G=180 B=0**. 
Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)** and set the **Corner Radius** to **65 pt** from the **Tool Options** bar. Create a **430 x 868 px** shape.

##Step 3

Make sure that your shape is still selected and go to the **Alignment** pane from the **Properties** panel. Simply click the **Horizontal Centers** and the **Vertical Centers** commands to easily move your selection in the center of the canvas.

##Step 4

Click on the canvas to deselect everything and  then focus on the **Toolbar**. Click that **Fill** color well and replace the yellow with red.

##Step 6

Focus on the **Layers** panel, double click the name of the existing layer and rename it &quot;_Main_&quot;. Using the plus button from the bottom, left corner of the panel, add a second layer and rename it &quot;_SH&amp;HL_&quot;. Make sure that this new layer stays selected, as the new objects you are about to create will go here.

Hit **Shift + Command + V** to easily add a copy of your blue rounded rectangle in the same place. Select this new shape and focus on the **Toolbar**. Click the **Fill** color well and replace that blue with white (**R=255 G=255 B=255**). Make sure that your white shape is still selected and copy it (**Command + C**).
