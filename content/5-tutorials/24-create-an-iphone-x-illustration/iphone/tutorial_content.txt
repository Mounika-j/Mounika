In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a detailed iPhone X illustration in Picta Graphic for iPhone. 

For starters, you will learn how to set up a simple grid, how to create several basic shapes and how to easily place them in the center of your canvas. Taking full advantage of the Effects pane, you will learn how to stylize your shape. Using basic vector shape building techniques, you will learn how to add subtle shading and highlights for your shapes. 

You will learn how to work inside the Layers panel and how to ease your work using the Copy/Paste Style feature. Finally, you will learn how to create two flat icons and how to add some basic pieces of text. 





##Step 1

Start by tapping the plus button from the top-left corner of your screen to create a new document. Tap the **Create Document** button and then choose the **Grid** document style.
