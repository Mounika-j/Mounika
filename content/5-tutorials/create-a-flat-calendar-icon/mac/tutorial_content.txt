In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a flat calendar icon in Graphic for Mac. 

For starters you will learn how to create a new document and how to setup a simple grid. Using basic tools, you will learn how to create the main icon shapes. Taking full advantage of the Effects pane you will learn how to add subtle details and some neat shading. Finally, you'll learn how to create a dashed stroke and how to add several pieces of text. 





##Step 1

For this tutorial we'll create a **600 x 600 px** document. Go to **File &gt; New (Command + N)** to bring up the **New Document** panel. Select the **Grid** document style and set the document units to **pixels**. Set the document dimensions to **600** pixels wide by **600** pixels high and then click **Choose** to create your document. 

Next, we'll adjust the document grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. You can easily open or close the **Properties** panel using that ruler icon. Change the **X** &amp; **Y Spacing** to **5**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0** and don't forget to enable **Snap to Grid** — all these features will make your work easier.

Keep in mind that you can quickly enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature using the  **Command +  '** and the  **Command + Shift + '** keyboard shortcuts.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar**, click that **Fill** color well and set it to **R=210 G=160 B=110**. Next, click  the **Stroke** color well and drag that **Alpha** slider to **0%** —  this will simply make the **Stroke** invisible. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)**, focus on your **Tool Options** bar  and drag the **Corner Radius** slider to **10 pt**. Move to your canvas and create a **145 x 140 px** shape.

##Step 3

Make sure that your rounded rectangle stays selected and focus on the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel  —  click the leftmost inspector panel icon to open or close the **Appearance** panel whenever you want.

Check the checkbox of the existing **Drop Shadow** effect to activate it and then simply click on it to expand it. Enter **1** in the **Y** box and **0** in the **X** box, drag the **Size** slider to **0 pt**, and then click the color well of this effect. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **100%** and set the color to **R=217 G=168 B=119**.

##Step 4

Make sure that your rounded rectangle stays selected and keep focusing on the **Effect**s pane from the **Appearance** panel. Right click on the existing **Drop Shadow** effect and go to **Duplicate**.

##Step 5

Make sure that your rounded rectangle stays selected, keep focusing on the **Effect**s pane and duplicate the bottom **Drop Shadow** effect.

Select the new effect and replace the existing attributes with the ones shown in the following image.

##Step 6

Make sure that your rounded rectangle stays selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** pane and add a new **Drop Shadow** effect using the plus button located in the bottom, left corner of the pane. 

Select this new effect, enter **6 pt**  in the **Y** box and **0 pt**  in the other two boxes, and then click its color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **10%** and set the color to black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**).

##Step 8
Make sure that your rounded rectangle stays selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** pane and activate the existing **Inner Shadow** effect. 

Enter **1 pt** in the **Y** box and **0 pt** in the other two boxes, and then click the color well of your **Inner Shadow** effect. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **15%** and set the color to white (**R=255 G=255 B=255**).

##Step 9

Return to your **Toolbar**, make sure that the **Stroke** is still invisible and  set the **Fill** color to **R=255 G=245 B=215**. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)**, focus on your **Tool Options** bar  and drag the **Corner Radius** slider to **5 pt**. 

Move to your canvas, create a **135 x 135 px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the following image — the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature should ease your work.

##Step 11

Make sure that your front rounded rectangle stays selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** pane and duplicate the existing **Drop Shadow**. 

Select the new effect and simply replace the existing attributes with the ones shown in the following image. 

(image: calendarIcon11.jpg)



##Step 12

Make sure that your front rounded rectangle stays selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** pane and duplicate the bottom **Drop Shadow**.

##Step 13

Make sure that your front rounded rectangle stays selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** pane and duplicate the bottom **Drop Shadow**. 

Select the new effect and  replace the existing attributes with the ones shown in the following image. 

(image: calendarIcon13.jpg)



##Step 14

Make sure that your front rounded rectangle stays selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** pane and duplicate the bottom **Drop Shadow**.

##Step 15

Make sure that your front rounded rectangle stays selected, keep focusing on the **Effects** pane and duplicate the bottom **Drop Shadow**. 

Focus on this new effect, set the **Blend Mode** to **Soft Light**, enter **6 pt**  in the **Y** box and **0 pt** in the other two boxes, and then click the color well of this effect. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **15%** and set the color to black.

##Step 16

Make sure that your front rounded rectangle stays selected and keep focusing on the **Effects** pane. You must add a new **Drop  Shadow** effect, but first you need to remove one of those inactive effects because you've reached the limit of twelve attributes for one shape. 

Right click on that inactive **Outer Glow** effect and then click the **Remove** command. Now you can add that new **Drop  Shadow** effect. Select it and  enter the attributes shown in the following image.

##Step 17

Make sure that your front  rounded rectangle stays selected and keep focusing on the **Effects** pane. 

Activate the existing **Inner Shadow** effect and enter the attributes shown in the following image. 

(image: calendarIcon17.jpg)



##Step 18

Make sure that your front rounded rectangle stays selected and keep focusing on the **Effects** pane. Remove that inactive **Inner Glow** effect and then add a second **Inner Shadow** effect. Select  it and enter the attributes shown in the following image.

##Step 19

Get back to your **Toolbar**, make sure that the **Stroke** is invisible and set the **Fill** color to **R=232 G=193 B=96**. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)**, focus on your **Tool Options** bar  and make sure that the **Corner Radius** is still set to **5 pt**. 

Move to your canvas, create a **75 x 25 px** shape and place it as shown in the first image. Duplicate this new rounded rectangle (**Command-C &gt; Command-V**). Using the **Move Tool (V)**, select the copy and place it as shown in the second image.

##Step 20

Now, you will need a grid every **1 px**. This simply means that you need to return to the **Grid**  pane from the **Properties** panel and enter **1 px** in both  **Spacing** boxes. 

Return to your **Toolbar** and this time make sure that the **Fill** is invisible and set the **Stroke** color to **R=235 G=225 B=195**. 

Pick the **Pen Tool (P)** or the **Line Tool (L)**, create a **135 px**, horizontal path and place it exactly as shown in the first image — holding down the **Shift** key while moving your cursor will constrain the angle to **45 degrees** increments, making it a lot easier for you to create a perfect straight line with the **Line Tool**.

Make sure that this new path stays selected and focus on the **Stroke** pane from the **Appearance** panel. Check the little checkbox that lies in the bottom, left corner of the pane and  then enter **3 px** in the first **Dash** and **Gap** boxes. In the end your horizontal path should look like in the second image.

##Step 21

Make sure that your horizontal path is still selected and focus on the **Effects** pane. Activate the existing **Drop Shadow** effect and enter the attributes shown in the following image.

##Step 22

For this step you need to enable the pixel preview which allows you to see how things would look if you decide to save your work as an image. Go to **View &gt; Show Pixels** and notice how your horizontal path gets a bit pixelated. This simply happens because your path is not perfectly aligned to the pixel grid, but can be fixed pretty easy. 

Make sure that your  path is still selected and go to **Modify &gt; Rotate &amp; Transform &gt; Transform**. Focus on the **Move** section, simply enter **0.5** in the **Vertical** box and click **OK**. Have a fresh look at your horizontal paths and things should look sleeker, as shown in the second image. Once you're done, return to **View &gt; Show Pixels** to disable this feature.

##Step 23


Get back to your **Toolbar**, make the **Stroke**  invisible and set the **Fill** color to **R=170 G=170 B=170**. 

Using the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)**, create a **15 x 1 px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the following image. 

(image: calendarIcon23.jpg)



##Step 24

Make sure that your grey shape is still selected and focus on the **Effects** pane. Activate the existing **Drop Shadow** effect and enter the attributes shown in the following image.

##Step 25

Pick the **Text Tool (T)**, simply click on your canvas and add the &quot;_September_&quot; piece of text. Make sure that it stays selected and go to the **Text** pane from the **Appearance** panel. Select the **DIN Condensed font**, make it **Bold** and set the size to **13 pt**. Move to the **Effects** pane and set that **Text** color to white. Finally, place it as shown in the first image. 

Make a copy of your text (**Command + C &gt; Command + V**), place it as shown in the second image and replace the &quot;_September_&quot; with &quot;_Tuesday_&quot;.

(image: calendarIcon25.jpg)



##Step 26

Reselect  the **Text Tool (T)** and add the &quot;_23_&quot; piece of text. Use the same  font, make sure that it's **Bold**, set the size to **40 pt** and change the color to **R=232 G=193 B=96**. 

Using the same tool, add the &quot;_Timmy's Birthday_&quot; piece of text. This time use the HanziPen SC font, make it **Bold**, set the size to **10 pt** and the color to **R=218 G=65 B=0**.
