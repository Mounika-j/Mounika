In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a set of outdoor floor plan symbols and how to save them inside a shape library. 

For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to use the canvas scale settings. Moving on you will learn how to take full advantage of the Snap to Grid feature and how to work with basic tools. 

You will learn how to easily save colors and styles and how to use them throughout the tutorial. Finally, you will learn how to create a new shape library, how to save your symbols and how to import or export existing shape libraries. 





##Step 1

Tap the plus button from the top left corner of the screen, tap the the **Create Document** button and then choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap that ruler icon to open the **Properties** panel. Go to the **Canvas** pane and open the **Units &amp; Scale** pane. 

We're about to create a ‘to-scale’ technical design using the canvas scale settings. First, make sure that the **Base Unit** is set to inches and then move to the bottom of the pane. Change the **Display Unit** from inches to feet and set one inch to stands for three feet. The actual paper size of the document will not change, only the displayed values and units are adjusted by this setting. 

Once you're done return to the **Canvas** pane and set the **Width** and **Height** to **56 ft**.

Next, you need to adjust your document's grid. Re-open the **Properties** panel and this time go to the **Grid** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**.
 
Open the **Grid Settings** pane, enter **0.1 ft** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in that one **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and notice that by default the **Fill** color is set to white while the **Line** color is set to black. Tap the **Line** color well and replace the existing color with **R=54 G=65 B=80** and then tap the **Fill** color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**, which will simply make the fill invisible. 

 Pick the **Line Tool**, move to your canvas and create a **4 ft** vertical line - the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.Tap and hold with a second finger while dragging to easily create a perfect path.

Make sure that this path stays selected and focus on the right side of your **Titlebar**. Tap the leftmost icon to open the **Appearance** panel, go to the **Effects** pane and then tap the existing **Stroke** to expand it. Drag the **Width**  slider to **4 pt** and then check the **Round Cap**, **Round Join** and **Center Alignment** buttons. 

You should also save the stroke color used for this shape as you are about to use it throughout the entire tutorial. Simply tap the **Stroke** color well from the **Effects**  pane (or the **Line** color well from your **Toolbar**), switch to the **Color Palette** and then drag your active color to one of the palette slots.

##Step 3

Make sure that your line is still selected, open the **Styles** pane from the **Appearance** panel and simply tap that plus button to save the attributes used for your selected shape. Using this style, you will be able to quickly apply the appearance attributes of this path to other paths.

##Step 6

Enable the **Snap to Grid**  feature and disable the **Snap to Points** feature. Using the **Ellipse Tool**, create a **0.8 ft** circle, place it as shown in the first image and apply your style from the **Styles** panel. 

Make sure that this new shape stays selected and simply tap and hold anywhere on your canvas to open that context menu. Use the **Copy** and the **Paste in Place** commands to add a copy of your selected circle in the same place. 
Pick the **Path Selection Tool**, focus on the newly opened **Tool Options** pane and activate the **Add to Selection** mode - this mode will allow you to easily select more than one object and can be really useful when you're dealing with overlapping shapes.  Simply tap the copy of the circle made in this step along with the compound path, open the **Combine** pane and tap the **Subtract** command.

##Step 10

Focus on the right side of your **Titlebar** and tap the rightmost icon to open the **Layers** panel. Use that plus button from the bottom of the panel to add a new layer and make sure it  stays selected, as the new shapes you are about to create will go here.

Using the **Ellipse Tool**, create a **0.4 ft** circle and apply your second style from the **Styles** panel. 

(image: furnitureShapesSecondiPhone10A.jpg)

Switch to the **Path Selection Tool**, select the top anchor point and drag it **0.5 ft** up as shown in the second image. 

Make sure that the **Path Selection Tool** is still active, focus on the **Tool Options** pane and select the **Convert** mode. Tap the anchor point that you moved a few moments ago and then return to the **Tool Options** pane and activate the default mode. Focus on the left and right anchor points and drag the top handles as shown in the fourth image. Once again, the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.

##Step 21

Finally, let's learn how to save your symbols inside a shape library. First, open the **Shape Libraries** panel using the button from the right side of your **Titlebar**. Tap the plus button from the top, right corner of the panel to create a new shape library and then tap that **Edit** button from the left corner. Tap your newly added shape library, rename it as you wish and then tap the **Done** button.

##Step 22

Open the **Layers** panel and select your second layer. Using the **Move Tool**, select all the shapes from your active layer and group them using the **Group** command from the **Properties** panel. 

Make sure that your group remains selected, open the **Shape Libraries** panel and tap your newest shape library to open it. Tap the **Edit** button from the top, right corner which will allow you to add new shape inside your active shape library. Tap the plus button from the bottom, right corner of the panel and your selected group will be immediately saved inside the active shape library. Once you're done tap the **Done** button. 

Your shape libraries and their content are always available and you can easily use them inside any new document. You can also import shape libraries using the import commands that are available whenever you tap that **New Document** button. 

Finally, feel free to add the rest of the symbols created so far and don't forget to **Group** the existing shapes and paths before you tap that plus button.
