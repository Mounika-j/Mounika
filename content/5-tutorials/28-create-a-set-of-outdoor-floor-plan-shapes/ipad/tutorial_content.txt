In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a set of outdoor floor plan symbols and how to save them inside a shape library. 

For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to use the canvas scale settings. Moving on you will learn how to take full advantage of the Snap to Grid feature and how to work with basic tools. 

You will learn how to easily save colors and styles and how to use them throughout the tutorial. Finally, you will learn how to create a new shape library, how to save your symbols and how to import or export existing shape libraries. 





##Step 1

Tap the plus button from the top, left corner of the screen to create a new document and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. Focus the **Canvas** pane and open the **Units &amp; Scale** pane. 

We're about to create a ‘to-scale’ technical design using the canvas scale settings. First, make sure that the **Base Unit** is set to inches and then move to the bottom of the pane. Change the display units from inches to feet and set one inch to stands for three feet. The actual paper size of the document will not change, only the displayed values and units are adjusted by this setting. 

Once you're done return to the **Canvas** pane and set the **Width** and **Height** to **56 ft**.

Next, you need to adjust your document's grid. Tap again that settings icon and switch from the **Canvas** pane to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. 

Open the **Grid Settings** pane, enter **0.1 ft** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in that one **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and notice that by default the **Fill** color is set to white while the **Line** color is set to black. Tap the **Line** color well and replace the existing color with **R=54 G=65 B=80** and then tap the **Fill** color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**, which will simply make the fill invisible. 

 Pick the **Line Tool**, move to your canvas and create a **4 ft** vertical line - the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.Tap and hold with a second finger while dragging to easily create a perfect path. Make sure that this path stays selected and focus on the right side of your **Titlebar**. Tap the leftmost icon, move to the **Effects** pane and then tap the existing **Stroke** to expand it. Drag the **Width**  slider to **4 pt** and then check the **Round Cap**, **Round Join** and **Center Alignment** buttons. 
 
You should also save the stroke color used for this shape as you are about to use it throughout the entire tutorial. Tap the Stroke color well from the **Effects**  pane (or the **Line** color well from your **Toolbar**) and then  drag the active color to one of the palette slots.

##Step 6

Enable the **Snap to Grid**  feature and disable the **Snap to Points ** feature. Using the **Ellipse Tool**, create a **0.8 ft** circle, place it as shown in the first image and apply your style from the **Styles** pane. 

Make sure that this new shape stays selected, focus on the left side of your **Titlebar** and tap that paperclip icon to open the **Edit** pane. Use the **Copy** and the **Paste in Place** commands to add a copy of your selected circle in the same place. 

Pick the **Path Selection Tool**, focus on the newly opened **Tool Options** pane and activate the **Add to Selection** mode - this mode will allow you to easily select more than one object and can be really useful when you're dealing with overlapping shapes.  Simply tap the copy of the circle made in this step along with the compound path, open the **Combine** pane and tap the **Subtract** command.
