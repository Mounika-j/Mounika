In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a set of outdoor floor plan symbols and how to save them inside a shape library. 

For starters, you will learn how to set up a simple grid and how to use the canvas scale settings. Moving on you will learn how to take full advantage of the Snap to Grid feature and how to work with basic tools. 

You will learn how to easily save colors and styles and how to use them throughout the tutorial. You will learn how to create, save and use a pattern or how to adjust and cut objects. 

Finally, you will learn how to create a new shape library, how to save your symbols and how to import or export existing shape libraries. 





##Step 1

For this tutorial we'll create a new **56 x 56 ft** document. Go to **File &gt; New** or hit the **Command + N** keyboard shortcut to bring up the **New Document** window. Select the **Grid** document style, select **inches** for the document unit, and then set the document dimensions to **56** inches wide by **56** inches high.

We're about to create a ‘to-scale’ technical design using the canvas scale settings. Simply open the **Canvas** pane from the **Properties** panel, change the scale unit from inches to feet and set one inch to stands for three feet. The actual paper size of the document will not change, only the displayed values and units are adjusted by this setting. 
Once you're done, return to the canvas size and set the **Width** and **Height** of your document to **56 ft**.

Next, you need to adjust the document's grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. Change the grid **X Spacing** and **Y Spacing** to **0.1**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0** and then enable the **Snap to Grid** feature. 

Keep in mind that you can quickly enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature using the  **Command +  '** and  **Command + Shift + '** keyboard shortcuts.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and notice that by default the **Fill** color is set to white while the **Stroke** color is set to black. Click the **Stroke** color well and replace the existing color with **R=54 G=65 B=80**, and then click the **Fill** color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**, which will simply make the fill invisible. 

 Pick the **Line Tool (L)**, move to your canvas and create a **4 ft** vertical line - the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work. Hold the **Shift** key while dragging to easily create a perfect straight path. Make sure that this path stays selected and go to the **Stroke** pane from the **Appearance** panel. Drag the **Line Weight** slider to **4 pt**, make sure that the **Position** is set to **Center**, and then check the **Round Cap** and **Round Join** buttons. 
 
You should also save the stroke color used for this shape as you are about to use it throughout the entire tutorial. Simply click the color well from the **Stroke** pane (or the **Stroke** color well from your **Toolbar**), switch from the **Color Picker**  to the **Color Palette** and  simply click that plus button to add your active color to the existing set of color.

##Step 26

Make sure that your new shape library is active and focus on the shapes that lie inside your &quot;_Plant_&quot; layer. Make sure that you select the layer from the **Layers** panel and then pick the **Move Tool (V)**. First, select all those shapes and **Group** them (**Command + G**). Simply click the plus button that lies in the bottom, left corner of the **Shape Library** panel and your selected group will be added inside your active shape library. 

Your shape libraries and their content are always available and you can easily add them inside any new document. You can also import/export shape libraries so that you can use them on different devices. Click that settings icon from the top, right corner and use the **Import Shape Library** and **Export** commands. 

Finally, feel free to add the rest of the symbols created so far. Select each layer and don't forget to **Group** the existing shapes and paths before you click that plus button.
