In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a simple clothespin illustration in Graphic for iPhone. 

For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create the main shapes using basic tools and vector shapes building techniques. Taking full advantage of the Effects pane, you will learn how to add subtle shading and highlights for your shape and how to easily recolor your final design. 





##Step 1

Start by tapping the   plus button from the top-left corner of your screen to create a new document. Tap the **Create Document** button and then choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar**, tap that ruler icon to open the **Properties** panel, and then tap the **Canvas** pane. Set both **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and be sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled. When this setting is enabled, stroked objects are offset slightly to ensure that the stroke is drawn aligned to the pixel grid which guarantees a crisp look.

Open the **Properties** panel and this time tap the **Grid** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid** feature. Finally, open the **Grid Settings** pane, enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar**, tap the **Fill** color well and replace the existing color with **R=205 G=135 B=54**. Tap the **Line** color well, drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this  will simply make your **Line** invisible. 

Pick the **Rectangle Tool**, focus on your canvas and create a **25 x 240 px** shape.

##Step 3

Make sure that your rectangle stays selected and pick the **Pen Tool**. Move to the **Tool Options** pane and activate the **Add Points** mode. Focus on the top side of your shape and  use a simple tap to add a new anchor point as shown in the following image — the grid will ease your work. 

Keep focusing on the top of your shape and switch to the **Path Selection Tool**. Select the left anchor point and drag it **100 px** down. Move to the bottom of your shape, select the left anchor point and drag it **35 px** up. In the end your shape should look like in the second image.

##Step 4

Using the **Ellipse Tool**, create a **50 x 70 px** shape and place it as shown in the first image. 

Switch to the **Rectangle Tool**, create a **25 x 35 px** shape and place it as shown in the second image. 

Pick the **Path Selection Tool**, focus on the newly opened **Tool Options** pane and activate the **Add to Selection** mode. Using simple taps, select the two shapes made in this step. Move to  the right side of your **Titlebar**, go to the **Combine**  pane from the **Properties** panel and tap the **Intersect** command.

##Step 5

Using the **Move Tool**, select both shapes made so far, go to the **Combine****** pane and tap the **Union** command.

##Step 6

Pick the **Ellipse Tool**, create a **10 px** circle and place it as shown in the first image — the color attributes are not  important. 

Using the same tool, create a **20 x 35 px** shape and place it as shown in the second image.

##Step 7

Select all the shapes made so far, go to the **Combine****** pane and tap the **Subtract** command.

##Step 8
Get back to your **Toolbar** and this time make the **Fill** invisible and  set the **Stroke** color to **R=205 G=135 B=54**. 

Using the **Pen Tool** or the **Line Tool**, create a **10 px**, horizontal path and place it exactly as shown in the following image. Make sure that this new path stays selected and focus on the right side of your **Titlebar**. Tap the leftmost icon to open the **Appearance** panel and go to the **Effects** pane. Tap the existing **Stroke** to expand it, drag the  **Width**  slider to **4 pt** and  check the **Round Cap** button. 

With your horizontal path still selected, tap and hold to open that context menu. Use the **Copy** and the **Paste** commands to easily duplicate your selection. Select the copy and place it as shown in the second image.

##Step 9

Now,  you will need a grid every **1 px**. This simply means that you need to return to the **Grid** pane,  open the **Grid Settings** pane and enter **1 px** for both **Spacing** boxes. 

 Keep focusing on your horizontal paths. Select the bottom one and drag it **2 px** down and then select the top one and drag it **1 px** up. 

(image: clothespinIllustrationiPhone9.jpg)



##Step 10

Make sure that both horizontal paths are selected, go to the **Path Tools**  pane and tap the **Outline Stroke** command.

##Step 11

Select all the shapes made so far, go to the **Combine** pane and tap the **Union** command. 

(image: clothespinIllustrationiPhone11.jpg)



##Step 12

Select your shape and  use the **Copy** and the **Paste in Place** commands from that context menu to add a copy of your selection in the same place. 

Select only this copy and open the **Geometry** pane from the **Properties** panel. Simply tap that **Flip Horizontally** button to flip your selection horizontally. Drag it to the left and place it exactly as shown in the third image. 

(image: clothespinIllustrationiPhone12.jpg)



##Step 13

Return to your **Toolbar**, make  the **Fill** is invisible and  set the **Line** color to **R=79 G=81 B=82**. 

Using the **Ellipse Tool**, create a **10 px** circle and place it as shown in the following image. Make sure that this new shape stays selected and focus on the **Effects** pane. Select the existing **Stroke** and simply drag the **Width** slider to **4 pt**. 

(image: clothespinIllustrationiPhone13.jpg)



##Step 14

Using the **Pen Tool** or the **Line Tool**, create a **55 px**, vertical path and place it as shown in the first image. Make sure that this new path stays selected, focus on the **Effects** pane and select the **Stroke**. 

Drag the  **Width** slider to **4 pt** and  check the **Round Cap** button. Switch to the **Path Selection Tool**, select the top anchor point and simply drag it **31 px** to the right. In the end things should look like in the second image. 

(image: clothespinIllustrationiPhone14.jpg)



##Step 15

Select your grey circle and that vertical path, focus on the **Path Tools** pane and tap the **Outline Stroke** command. Make sure that the resulting shapes remain selected, move to the **Combine** pane and tap the **Union** command. In the end your grey shape should look like in the third image. 

(image: clothespinIllustrationiPhone15.jpg)



##Step 16

Get back to your **Toolbar**, make sure that the **Line** is invisible and  set the **Fill** color to **R=79 G=81 B=82**. 

Using the **Ellipse Tool**, create a **4 px** circle and place it as shown in the following image.

##Step 17

Focus on the right side of your **Titlebar** and tap the rightmost icon to open the **Layers** panel. 

Simply tap  the exiting layer to open that menu and  tap the **Duplicate** command. Select the top layer and then tap on your canvas to close the **Layers** panel. 

(image: clothespinIllustrationiPhone17A.jpg)

Pick the **Move Tool**, select all your shapes and open the **Combine** pane. First, tap the **Union** command and then tap the **Make** command. Select the resulting shape, focus on the **Effects** pane and replace the existing **Fill** color with **R=155 G=91 B=33**. We'll use this dark brown shape to add a subtle shadow to the entire clothespin shape.

##Step 18

Open the **Layers** panel, simply tap and hold on the thumbnail of the top layer and drag it below the other layer. Make sure that your bottom layer remains selected and  close the **Layers** panel.
