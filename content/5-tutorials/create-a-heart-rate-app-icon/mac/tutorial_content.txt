In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a heart rate app icon in Picta Graphic for Mac. 

For starters, you will learn how to set up a simple grid and how to create a pixel perfect heart shape using basic vector shape building techniques. Taking full advantage of the Effects pane, you will learn how to stylize your heart shape. Using a rounded rectangle and some subtle shading, you will learn how to create the frame of your icon. Finally, you will learn how to create a flat background for your icon. 

If you're new to Graphic and fear that you might not be able to easily follow the tutorial, a quick read of the [Graphic User Guide](http://graphic.com/docs/welcome) might be what you need. It's not a must, but it will help you get familiarized with Graphic's interface, tools and features. Whether you read it or not following the tutorial should be fairly easy. Let's get started.





##Step 1

For this tutorial we'll create a **680 x 680 px** document. Go to **File &gt; New (Command - N)** to bring up the **New Document** pop-up window. Select the **Grid** document style and set the document units to **pixels**. Set the document dimensions to **680** pixels wide by **680** pixels high and then click **Choose** to create your document. 

Next, we'll adjust the document grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. You can easily open or close the **Properties** panel using that ruler icon. Change the **X** &amp; **Y Spacing** to **5**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0** and don't forget to enable **Snap to Grid** â€“ all these features will make your work easier.

You can quickly enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature using the  **Command + '** and the  **Command + Shift + '** keyboard shortcuts.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and click the **Stroke** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** to simply make your **Stroke** invisible. Click the **Fill** color well and replace the existing color with **R=243 G=76 B=73**. 

Pick the **Ellipse tool (O)**, focus on your canvas and create a **140 x 170  px** shape.

##Step 3

Pick the **Move tool (V)**, select your shape and open the **Geometry** pane from the **Properties** panel. 

Focus on the **Position** settings, set the **X** value to **270 px** and the **Y** value to **235 px**. This will numerically move your selected shape as shown in the following image.

##Step 4

Make sure that your shape stays selected and pick the **Convert Anchor tool**. Simply click the top and bottom anchor points to convert those smooth points into corner points.

##Step 5

Keep focusing on your shape and pick the **Path Selection tool (A)**. 

Select the top anchor point and drag it **85 px** down. Hold down the **Shift** key while dragging to constrain the movement of your selection to a single direction.

##Step 6

Click the **Fill** color well from your **Toolbar** and replace the existing color with a random yellow. 

Pick the **Ellipse tool (O)** and create two, **70 px** circles. Place these new shapes as shown in the following images. The grid and the Snap to Grid feature will definitely help.

##Step 7

Pick the **Move tool (V)** and select the three shapes made so far. Open the **Path Tools** pane from the **Properties** panel and click the **Union** command. 

The resulting object will be your heart shape and it should look like in the second image. Select it and copy it (**Command + C**). You'll need a copy of this shape a few steps later.

##Step 8
Make sure that your heart shape is still selected and open the **Stroke** pane from the **Appearance** panel. You can easily open or close the **Appearance**  panel using that info icon. 

Set the stroke color to **R=254 G=254 B=254** and drag the **Line Weight** slider to **25 pt**. Set the **Position** to **Outside** and don't forget to check that **Round Join** button.

##Step 9

Make sure that your heart shape stays selected and open the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel. 

Check the rounded square of the existing **Inner Glow** effect to activate it. Drag the **Size** slider to **20 pt** and then click the color well of this effect. Change the color to **R=242 G=242 B=247** and be sure that the **Alpha** slider is set to **100%**.

##Step 10

Simply hit **Shift + Command + X** to add a copy of your heart shape in the same place. Select it and focus on the **Stroke** pane from the **Appearance** panel. 

Set the stroke color to **R=242 G=76 B=73** and drag the **Line Weight** slider to **20 pt**. Set the **Position** to **Center** and don't forget to check that **Round Join** button.

##Step 11

Make sure that the heart shape added in the previous step stays selected and focus on the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel. 

Activate the existing **Drop Shadow** effect and select it. Set the **X** value to **0 pt** and the **Y** value to **10 pt**, drag the **Size** slider to **20 pt**, and then click the color well of this effect. Change the color to **R=243 G=77 B=74** and drag that **Alpha** slider to **50%**.

##Step 12

Pick the **Pen tool (P)** and draw a jagged path as shown in the following image. Make sure that the **Fill** color is set to none and then focus on the **Stroke** pane from the **Appearance** panel.

Set the stroke color to **R=254 G=254 B=254** and drag the **Line Weight** slider to **10 pt**. Set the **Position** to **Center** and don't forget to check that **Round Join** button.

##Step 13

Make sure that your jagged path stays selected and focus on the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel. 

Activate the existing **Drop Shadow** effect and select it. Set the **X** value to **0 pt** and the **Y** value to **5 pt**. Change the **Blend Mode** to **Soft Light** and drag the **Size** slider to **10 pt**, and then click the color well of this effect. Change the color to black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**) and drag that **Alpha** slider to **50%**.

##Step 14

Go to the **Layers** panel. If the **Layers** panel is not currently visible, you can easily open it using the rightmost inspector panel icon. Double-click on the layer&rsquo;s name field and rename it &quot;_Heart_&quot;. Click that **Add** (**+**) button from the bottom of the panel to add a second layer and select it. Rename it &quot;_Frame_&quot; and drag it below your &quot;_Heart_&quot; layer. Make sure that this &quot;_Frame_&quot; layer stays selected, as the new shapes you are about to create will go here.

For this step you will need a grid every **1 px** which simply means that you need to return to the **Grid**  pane from the **Properties** panel and enter **1 px** in both  **Spacing** boxes. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle tool (Shift + M)**, focus on the **Tool Options** bar and set the **Corner Radius** to **55 pt**. Move to your canvas and create a **256 px** square with rounded corners. Hold the **Shift** key while dragging to easily create squares with rounded corners. 

Fill this new shape with **R=254 G=254 B=254**, make sure that it stays selected and open the **Alignment** pane from the **Properties** panel. Simply click the **Horizontal Centers** and **Vertical Centers** commands to move your selection in the center of the canvas.

##Step 15

Open the **Grid**  pane from the **Properties** panel and enter **5 px** in both  **Spacing** boxes. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle tool (Shift + M)** and set the **Corner Radius** to **70 pt**. Create a **190 x 180 px** shape and place it as shown in the following image. Make sure that it stays selected and go to the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel. 

Select the existing **Fill** and replace the color with a **Linear Gradient**. Set the **Angle** to **90 degrees** and then focus on the gradient sliders. Select the right gradient slider, set the color to **R=243 G=77 B=74** and keep the **Alpha** slider at **100%**. Select the left gradient slider, set the color to **R=243 G=77 B=74** and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**.

##Step 16

Make sure that your gradient filled shape stays selected and keep focusing on the **Effects** pane. Activate the **Blur** effect and drag the **Radius** slider to **25 pt**.

##Step 17

Make sure that your gradient filled shape is still selected and send it to back (**Shift + Command + [**).

##Step 18

Pick the **Rectangle tool (M)** and create a **680 px** square. Fill this new shape with **R=242 G=242 B=247**, make sure that it covers your entire canvas, and then send it to back (**Shift + Command + [**)
