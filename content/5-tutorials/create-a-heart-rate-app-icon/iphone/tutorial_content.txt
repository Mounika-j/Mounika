In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a heart rate app icon in Picta Graphic for iPhone. 

For starters, you will learn how to set up a simple grid and how to create a pixel perfect heart shape using basic vector shape building techniques. Taking full advantage of the Effects pane, you will learn how to stylize your heart shape. Using a rounded rectangle and some subtle shading, you will learn how to create the frame of your icon. Finally, you will learn how to create a flat background for your icon. 





##Step 1

Start by tapping the plus button from the top-left corner of your screen to create a new document. Tap the **Create Document** button and then choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar**, tap that ruler icon to open the **Properties** panel, and then tap the **Canvas** pane. 

Set both **Width** and **Height** to **680 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and be sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled. When this setting is enabled, stroked objects are offset slightly to ensure that the stroke is drawn aligned to the pixel grid which guarantees a crisp look.

Open the **Properties** panel and this time tap the **Grid** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid** feature. Open the **Grid Settings** pane, enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and tap the **Line** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** to simply make your **Line** invisible. Tap the **Fill** color well and replace the existing color with **R=243 G=76 B=73**. 
Pick the **Ellipse tool**, focus on your canvas and create a **140 x 170  px** shape.

##Step 3

Pick the **Move tool** and select your shape. Tap that ruler icon from your **Titlebar** to open the **Properties** panel and go to the **Geometry** pane.

Focus on the **Position** settings, set the **X** value to **270 px** and the **Y** value to **235 px**. This will numerically move your selected shape as shown in the following image.

##Step 4

Make sure that your shape stays selected, pick the **Path Selection tool** and activate the **Convert mode** from the **Tool pane**. Simply tap the top and bottom anchor points to convert those smooth points into corner points.

##Step 5

Keep focusing on your shape and make sure that the **Path Selection tool** is still active. Switch back to the **Select mode** from the **Tool pane**. 

Select the top anchor point and drag it **85 px** down. The grid and the Snap to Grid feature will come in handy.

##Step 6

Tap the **Fill** color well from your **Toolbar** and replace the existing color with a random yellow. 

Pick the **Ellipse tool**  and create two, **70 px** circles. Place these new shapes as shown in the following images. Once again, the grid and the Snap to Grid feature will help.

##Step 7

Pick the **Move tool**  and select the three shapes made so far. Open the **Combine** pane from the **Properties** panel and tap the **Union** command.

 The resulting object will be your heart shape and it should look like in the second image. Select it and tap &amp; hold anywhere on the canvas until the context menu appears. Simply tap the **Copy** command to copy your selected object. You'll need a copy of this shape a few steps later.

##Step 8

Make sure that your heart shape stays selected. Tap the leftmost icon from your **Titlebar** to open the **Appearance** panel and then go to the **Effects** pane.

Set the stroke color to **R=254 G=254 B=254** and drag the  **Width** slider to **25 pt**. Set the **Alignment** to **Outside** and don't forget to check that **Round Join** button.

##Step 9

Make sure that your heart shape stays selected and keep focusing on the **Effects** pane.

Check the round checkbox of the existing **Inner Glow** effect to activate it. Drag the **Blur** slider to **20**  and then tap the color well of this effect. Change the color to **R=242 G=242 B=247** and be sure that the **Alpha** slider is set to **100%**.

##Step 10

Tap and hold anywhere on the canvas to re-open that context menu. Tap the **Paste in Place** command to add a copy of your heart shape in the same place. Select it and focus on the **Effects** pane. 

Set the stroke color to **R=242 G=76 B=73** and drag the  **Width** slider to **20 pt**. Set the **Alignment** to **Center** and don't forget to check that **Round Join** button.

##Step 11

Make sure that the heart shape added in the previous step stays selected and focus on the **Effects** pane.

Activate the existing **Drop Shadow** effect and select it. Set the **X Offset** value to **0 pt** and the **Y Offset** value to **10 pt**, drag the **Blur** slider to **20**, and then tap the color well of this effect. Change the color to **R=243 G=77 B=74** and drag that **Alpha** slider to **50%**.

##Step 12

Pick the **Pen tool** and draw a jagged path as shown in the following image. Make sure that the **Fill** color is set to none and then focus on the **Effects** pane.

Set the stroke color to **R=254 G=254 B=254** and drag the  **Width**  slider to **10 pt**. Set the **Alignment**  to **Center** and don't forget to check that **Round Join** button.

##Step 13

Make sure that your jagged path stays selected and focus on the **Effects** pane.

Activate the existing **Drop Shadow** effect and select it. Set the **X Offset**  value to **0 pt** and the  **Y Offset** value to **5 pt**. Drag the **Blur** slider to **10** and then tap the color well of this effect. Change the color to black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**) and drag that **Alpha** slider to **50%**. Return the the **Effects** pane and tap the settings button of this effect. Tap the **Blend Mode** command and select **Soft Light** from that list.

##Step 14

Open the **Layers** panel using the rightmost icon from your **Titlebar**. Tap that **Add** (**+**) button from the bottom of the panel to add a second layer. Drag it below the existing layer and make sure that it stays selected, as the new shapes you are about to create will go here.

For this step you will need a grid every **1 px**. This simply means that you need to return to the **Grid** pane, open the **Grid Settings** pane and enter **1 px** for both **Spacing** boxes. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle tool**, focus on the **Tool pane** and set the  **Radius** to **55**. Move to your canvas and create a **256 px** square with rounded corners. Tap and hold with a second finger while dragging to easily create a square with rounded corners. 

Fill this new shape with **R=254 G=254 B=254**, make sure that it stays selected and open the **Align**  pane from the **Properties** panel. Simply tap the  **Horizontal** and **Vertical** commands to move your selection in the center of the canvas.

##Step 15

Return to the **Grid** pane, open the **Grid Settings** pane and enter **5 px** for both **Spacing** boxes. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle tool** and set the **Radius** to **70**. Create a **190 x 180 px** shape and place it as shown in the following image. Make sure that it stays selected and go to the **Effects** pane.

Tap the color well of the existing **Fill** and replace the color with a **Linear Gradient**. Set the **Angle** to **90 degrees** and then focus on the gradient sliders. Select the left gradient slider, set the color to **R=243 G=77 B=74** and keep the **Alpha** slider at **100%**. Select the right gradient slider, set the color to **R=243 G=77 B=74** and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**.

##Step 16

Make sure that your gradient filled shape stays selected and keep focusing on the **Effects** pane. Activate the **Blur** effect and drag the **Blur** slider to **25**.

##Step 17

Make sure that your gradient filled shape is still selected, open the **Arrange** pane from the **Properties** panel and drag that **Order** slider to the left end. This will send your selection to back, behind the existing shapes.

##Step 18

Pick the **Rectangle tool** and create a **680 px** square. Fill this new shape with **R=242 G=242 B=247**, make sure that it covers your entire canvas, and then send it to back.
