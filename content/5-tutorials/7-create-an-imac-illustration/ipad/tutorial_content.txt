In the following tutorial you will learn how to create an iMac illustration in Graphic for iPad. 

For starters you will learn how to set up a simple grid and how to create the main shapes using basic tools and vector shape building techniques. Using several gradients, some effects and basic blending techniques, you will learn how to add color and subtle highlights for your design. 

Finally, you will learn how to add an image fill and how to turn text into editable vector shapes. 





##Step 1

From the **Documents Browser**, tap the plus button at the top-left corner of the **Titlebar** and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. Go to the **Canvas** pane, set the **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and make sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled.

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** pane.make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open that **Grid Settings** pane, enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the Toolbar and   notice that by default the **Fill** color is set to white while the **Line** color is set to black. Tap  the **Fill** color well and set the  color to **R=0 G=152 B=245** and then tap the **Line** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this  will simply make your **Line** invisible. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, focus on the newly opened tool pane and set the  **Radius** slider to **10**. Move to your canvas and  create a **355 x 255 px** shape - the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work. 

Make sure that this blue shape stays  selected and, focus on the left side of your **Titlebar** and tap that paperclip icon to open the **Edit** pane. First, tap the **Copy** command and then tap the **Paste in Place** command to quickly add a copy of your selected shape in the same place.

##Step 3

Focus on your Toolbar and replace the existing **Fill** color with **R=255 G=185 B=2**. Pick the **Rectangle Tool**, create a **355 x 40px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the following image.

##Step 4

Pick the **Path Selection Tool**, focus on the newly opened tool pane and active the **Add to Selection** mode. Select your yellow rectangle along with the copy of that blue, rounded rectangle and focus on the right side of your Titlebar. Tap that rectangular icon, go to the **Combine** pane and tap the **Intersect** command.  Make sure that the resulting shape stays selected , return to the right side of your Titlebar and tap leftmost icon. 

Move to the **Effect** pane and tap the color well that stands for the existing **Fill**. Tap the **Gradient Fill** and the **Linear** buttons, set the angle to **0 degrees** and then  move to the gradient sliders. Select the left one and set its color to **R=148 G=150 B=152** and then select the right slider and se its color to **R=210 G=211 B=213**.

##Step 5

Make sure that your gradient filled shape stays selected, keep focusing on the **Effect** **** pane and simply check the  box that stands for the existing **Inner Shadow** effect to activate it.

Set the color to white (**R=255 G=255 B=255**) and drag the **Alpha** slider  to **50%**. Keep focusing on the **Effects** pane, tap the cogwheel icon that stands for your **Inner Shadow** effect and go to **Blend Mode**.

##Step 7

Make sure that your orange rectangle stays selected and pick the **Pen Tool**. Focus on the newly opened tool pane and activate the **Add Points** mode. Get back to your orange rectangle and simply add four new anchor points as shown in the first image. 

Switch to the **Path Selection Tool ** and focus on the left side of your orange rectangle. Select the top anchor point and drag it **20 px** to the right and then select the middle anchor point and drag it **15 px** to the right. Move to the right side of your orange shape. Select the top anchor point and drag it **20 px** to the left and then select the middle anchor point and drag it **15 px** to the left. In the end your orange shape should look like in the third image.

##Step 8

 For the following steps you will need a grid every **1 px**. This simply means that you need to return to the **Grid &amp; Rulers**  pane, open the **Grid Settings** pane and   enter **1 px** in both  **Spacing** boxes. 
 
Focus on the bottom, left corner of your orange shape and pick the **Path Selection Tool**. Select the left anchor point and drag it **2 px** up and then select the right anchor point and drag it **5 px** to the left. Move to the bottom, right corner of your orange shape. Select the right anchor point and drag it **2 px** up and then select the left anchor point and drag it **5 px** to the right. In the end things should look like in the second image.
