In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a glowing power button in Graphic for iPad. 

For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid, how to create the main shapes and how to easily center them. Using basic vector shape building techniques and some stroke tricks, you will learn how to create that power symbol. Taking full advantage of the Effects pane, you will learn how to add complex shading and highlights for your shapes. 

Finally, you will learn how to add a bit of color to your final button using vibrant colors along with the Outer Glow effect. 




##Step 1

From the **Documents Browser**, tap the plus button at the top-left corner of the **Titlebar** and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. Go to the **Canvas** pane, set the **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and make sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled. When this setting is enabled, stroked objects are offset slightly to ensure that the stroke is drawn aligned to the pixel grid which guarantees a crisp look.

Next, you need to setup the document grid. Tap again that **Settings** icon and switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open that **Grid Settings** pane, enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and   notice that by default the **Fill** color is set to white while the **Line** color is set to black. Tap the **Fill** color well and set its color to **R=6 G=115 B=179** and then tap the **Line** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this  will simply make your line invisible. 

Pick the **Ellipse Tool**, move to your canvas and  create a **130 px** circle- the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work. 

Make sure that your  shape stays selected, focus on the right side of your **Titlebar** and tap that middle icon. Go to the **Arrange** pane and simply tap the **Align Horizontal** and  **Align Vertical** buttons to bring your circle in the center of the canvas.

##Step 3

Focus on your **Toolbar**, set the **Fill** color to **R=226 G=170 B=0** and make sure that the **Ellipse Tool**  is still active. Create a **120 px** circle and center it using the same **Align Horizontal** and **Align Vertical**  buttons from the **Arrange** pane. 

Return to your **Toolbar** and set the **Fill** color to **R=44 G=163 B=15**. Create a **110 px** circle and center it.

##Step 4

Set the **Fill** color to **R=20 G=20 B=25**, make sure that the **Ellipse Tool**  is still active and create a **40 px** circle. Replace the existing **Fill** color with a random yellow and switch to the **Rectangle Tool**. Create a **40 x 20 px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the second image. 

Focus on the bottom side of your yellow rectangle and pick the **Path Selection Tool**. First, select the right anchor point and remove it using the **X** button from the left side of your **Titlebar**. Next, select the other anchor point and drag it **20 px** to the right. Switch to the **Move Tool** and  select both shapes made in this step. Open the **Combine** pane and simply tap the **Subtract** button.

Go to the **Effect** pane, remove the color from the **Fill** and select the **Stroke**. Drag the **Width** slider to **8 pt** and then tap the color well that stands for this **Stroke**. Replace the existing color with **R=20 G=20 B=25** and drag the **Alpha** slider to **100%**.

##Step 6

Make sure that your dark path is still selected and pick the **Pen Tool**. Focus on the newly opened **Tool Options** pane and activate the **Cut Paths** mode. Move to your canvas and simply  tap the anchor point highlighted in the first image to cut your selected path. 

Switch to the **Path Selection Tool**, select the oblique path highligthed in the second image and remove it using the **X** button from your **Titlebar**. Using the same tool, select the anchor point highlighted in the third image and get rid of this using that same **X** button. 

Select the remaining  path, focus on the **Effects** pane and check that **Round Cap** button. In the end things should look like in the fourth image.
