In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a glowing power button in Graphic for Mac. 

For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid, how to create the main shapes and how to easily center them. Using basic vector shape building techniques and some stroke tricks, you will learn how to create that power symbol. Taking full advantage of the Effects pane, you will learn how to add complex shading and highlights for your shapes. 

Finally, you will learn how to add a bit of color to your final button using vibrant colors along with the Outer Glow effect. 





##Step 1

Go to **File &gt; New (Command + N)** to bring up the **New Document** window. Select the **Grid** document style, set the document units to **pixels**, and set the document dimensions to **600** pixels wide by **600** pixels high.

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. If the **Properties** panel is not currently visible, you can easily open it using the ruler icon that lies above the **Layers** panel. Change the grid **X Spacing** and **Y Spacing** to **5**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0** and enable **Snap to Grid (Command + Shift + ')**.

Keep in mind that you can quickly enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature using the  **Command +  '** and  **Command + Shift + '** keyboard shortcuts.

##Step 2

Focus on the Toolbar and  notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the stroke color is set to black. Click  the **Fill** color well and set it to **R=6 G=115 B=179** and then click the **Stroke** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this will simply make your stroke invisible. 

Pick the **Ellipse Tool (O)**, move to your canvas and  create a **130 px** circle- the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work. 

Make sure that your  shape stays selected, go to the **Alignment** pane from the **Properties** panel and simply click the **Horizontal Centers** and  **Vertical Centers** buttons to bring your circle in the center of the canvas.

##Step 3

Focus on your Toolbar, set the **Fill** color to **R=226 G=170 B=0** and make sure that the **Ellipse Tool (O)** is still active. Create a **120 px** circle and center it using the same **Horizontal Centers** and **Vertical Centers** buttons from the **Alignment** pane. 

Return to your Toolbar and set the **Fill** color to **R=44 G=163 B=15**. Create a **110 px** circle and center it.

##Step 4

Set the **Fill** color to **R=20 G=20 B=25**, make sure that the **Ellipse Tool (O)** is still active and create a **40 px** circle. Replace the existing **Fill** color with a random yellow and switch to the **Rectangle Tool (M)**. Create a **40 x 20 px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the second image. 

Focus on the bottom side of your yellow rectangle and pick the **Path Selection Tool (A)**. First, select the right anchor point and remove it using the **Delete** key. Next, select the other  anchor point and drag it **20 px** to the right. Switch to the **Move Tool (V)**, select both shapes made in this step and go to the **Path Tools** pane from the **Properties** panel.  Simply click that **Subtract** button and your shape will look like in the fourth image.

##Step 5

Make sure that your dark shape is still selected and simply hit **Shift + X** to quickly transfer the color properties from  **Fill** to  **Stroke**. 

Focus above the **Layers** panel and simply click the leftmost icon to open the **Appearance** panel. Move to the **Effects** pane, select that **Stroke** and  drag the **Width** slider to **8 pt**.

##Step 6

Make sure that your dark path is still selected and pick the **Pen Tool (P)**. Focus on the **Tool Options** bar and activate the **Cut Paths** mode. Move to your canvas and simply  click the anchor point highlighted in the first image to cut your selected path. 

Switch to the **Path Selection Tool**, select the oblique path highligthed in the second image and remove it using the **Delete** key. Using the same tool, select the anchor point highlighted in the third image and get rid of this using that same **Delete** (or Backspace) key. 

Select the remaining  path, focus on the **Stroke** pane from the **Appearance** panel and check the **Round Cap** button. In the end things should look like in the fourth image.

##Step 7

Using the **Pen Tool (P)** or the **Line Tool (L)**, create a **15 px**, vertical path and place it as shown in the following image.

Make sure that the **Stroke** color is set to **R=20 G=20 B=25**, drag the **Line Height**  slider to **8 pt** and don't forge to check that **Round Cap** button.
