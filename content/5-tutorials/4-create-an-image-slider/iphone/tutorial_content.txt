In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a simple image slider UI in  Graphic for iPhone. 

For starters, you will learn how to set up a simple grid and how to create the main shapes using basic tools and vector shape building techniques. Using the Effects pane, you will learn how to add subtle shading and highlights for your shapes. 

Finally, you'll learn how to create and adjust image fills and how to add simple pieces of text. 





##Step 1

Start by tapping the   plus button from the top-left corner of your screen to create a new document. Tap the **Create Document** button and then choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar**, tap that ruler icon to open the **Properties** panel and then tap the **Canvas** pane. Set the **Width** to **600 px** and the **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit and be sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled.

Re-open the **Properties** panel and this time tap the **Grid** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open the **Grid Settings** pane and enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the line color is set to black. 

Tap the fill color well and set the color to **R=235 G=235 B=235** and then tap the line color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this will simply make your line invisible. Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, focus on the newly opened **Tool Options** pane and drag that **Radius** slider to **5**. Move to your canvas and simply create a **370 x 220 px** shape.

Go to the **Effects** pane and select the existing **Stroke**. Drag the **Width** slider to **2 pt**, select the **Inside Alignment** button and then tap  the color well that stands for your **Stroke**. Drag the **Alpha** slider at **100%** and replace the existing color with a simple white (**R=255 G=255 B=255**). Return to the **Effects** pane and tap the cogwheel icon that stands for your **Stroke**. Tap the **Blend Mode** command and select the **Soft Light** blend mode.
