In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a simple image slider UI in  Graphic for Mac. 

For starters, you will learn how to set up a simple grid and how to create the main shapes using basic tools and vector shape building techniques. Using the Effects pane, you will learn how to add subtle shading and highlights for your shapes. 

Finally, you'll learn how to create and adjust image fills and how to add simple pieces of text. 





##Step 1

Go to **File &gt; New (Command + N)** to bring up the **New Document** window. Select the **Grid** document style, set the document units to **pixels**, and set the document dimensions to **600** pixels wide by **500** pixels high.

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. If the **Properties** panel is not currently visible, you can easily open it using the ruler icon that lies above the **Layers** panel. Change the grid **X Spacing** and **Y Spacing** to **5**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0**, and enable **Snap to Grid (Command + Shift + ')**.

Keep in mind that you can quickly enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature using the  **Command +  '** and  **Command + Shift + '** keyboard shortcuts.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and  notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the stroke color is set to black. 

Click on the fill color well and set the  color to **R=235 G=235 B=235** and then click on the stroke color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this  will simply make your stroke invisible. Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)**, focus on the **Tool Options** bar and drag the **Corner Radius** slider to **5 pt**. Move to your canvas and simply create a **370x 220 px** shape.

##Step 3

Make sure that your rounded rectangle stays selected and focus on the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel. If the **Appearance** pane is not currently visible, you can easilt open it using the leftmost icon that lies above the **Layers** panel. 

Select the existing **Stroke**, drag the **Width** slider to **2 pt**, select **Inside** from the **Position** drop-down menu and **Soft Light** from the **Blend** drop-down menu and then  click  the color well that stands for your **Stroke**. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **100%** and replace the existing color with a simple white (**R=255 G=255 B=255**).

##Step 4

Drag the **Alpha** slider to **15%** and replace the existing color with a simple black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**). Finally, drag this effect right above the bottom stroke as shown in the following image.

Reselect your blue rectangle and focus on the **Effects** pane. Select the existing **Fill**, select **Image** from the **Type** drop-down menu and simply add the image downloaded a few moments ago. You will probably notice that the image doesn't cover your entire rectangle, but this little issue can be solved pretty fast. Keep focusing on the **Effects** pane and simply drag the **Scale** slider at around **110%**.
