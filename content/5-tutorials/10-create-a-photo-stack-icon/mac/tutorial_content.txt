In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a simple photos icon in  Graphic for Mac. 

For starters you will learn how to set up a simple grid and how to enable the Snap to Grid feature. Next, you'll learn how to create a simple shape, how to fill it with a linear gradient and how to add an image inside your document. Taking full advantage of the Effects pane, you will learn how to add subtle shading and highlights. 

Finally, you'll learn how to rotate objects and how to easily adjust image fills. 





##Step 1

Go to **File &gt; New (Command + N)** to bring up the **New Document** window. Select the **Grid** document style, set the document units to **pixels**, and set the document dimensions to **600** pixels wide by **600** pixels high.

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. If the **Properties** panel is not currently visible, you can easily open it using the ruler icon that lies above the **Layers** panel. Change the grid **X Spacing** and **Y Spacing** to **5**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0**, and enable **Snap to Grid (Command + Shift + ')**.

Keep in mind that you can quickly enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature using the  **Command +  '** and  **Command + Shift + '** keyboard shortcuts.

##Step 2


Focus on your **Toolbar** and   notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the stroke color is set to black. Click that stroke color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**. This will simply make the stroke invisible. Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool  (Shift + M)**, focus on your **Tool Options** bar and drag the **Corner Radius** slider to **3 pt**. Move to your canvas and create a **220 x 265 px** shape - the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.

Make sure that your shape stays selected and focus on the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel. If the **Appearance** panel is not currently visible, you can easily open it using the leftmost icon that lies above the **Layers** panel. 

Focus on the existing **Fill** and select **Linear  Gradient** from the **Type** drop-down menu. Set the angle to **90 degrees** and then move to the gradient sliders. Select the left one and set its color to **R=200 G=201 B=202** and then select the right one and se its color to **R=240 G=241 B=242**. Simply click on the gradient bar and you will get a new gradient slider. Select it, set the color to **R=220 G=221 B=222** and drag it to the left until the **Location** tooltip shows **15%**.

##Step 3

Download [this image](http://pixabay.com/en/sunset-landscape-assam-india-169925/) and drag it inside your Graphic document. Make sure that it stays selected and focus on the **Geometry** pane from the **Properties** panel. 
Check the **Constrain width and height** button (highlighted in the following image) and then  enter **200 px** in the **Height** box. This will simply resize your image without messing the proportions. Place your image exactly as shown in the first image. 

Get back to your Toolbar, select the fill and replace the existing color with a simple white (**R=255 G=255 B=255**). Pick the **Rectangle Tool (M)**, create a **200 px** square and place it exactly as shown in the second image.
