In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a simple photos icon in  Graphic for iPad. 

For starters you will learn how to set up a simple grid and how to enable the Snap to Grid feature. Next, you'll learn how to create a simple shape, how to fill it with a linear gradient and how to add an image inside your document. Taking full advantage of the Effects pane, you will learn how to add subtle shading and highlights. 

Finally, you'll learn how to rotate objects and how to easily adjust image fills. 





##Step 1

From the **Documents Browser**, tap the plus button at the top-left corner of the **Titlebar** and choose the **Grid** document style.
Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. Go to the **Canvas** pane, set the **Width** and **Height** to **600 px** and select **Pixels** for the base unit.

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or then **Snap to Grid**. Finally, simply tap that **Grid Spacing** pane, enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2


Focus on the **Toolbar** and   notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the line color is set to black. Tap  the line color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**. This will make your line invisible. 

Move to the fill color and tap it. Select **Gradient Fill** and **Linear**, set the angle to **-90 degrees** and then  move to the gradient sliders. Select the left one and set its color to **R=200 G=201 B=202** and then select the right one and se its color to **R=240 G=241 B=242**. Simply tap on the gradient bar and you will get a new gradient slider. Select it, set the color to **R=220 G=221 B=222** and drag it to the left until the **Location** tooltip shows **15%**.

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, focus on the newly opened **Tool Options pane** and drag the ** Radius** slider to **3**. Move to your canvas and simply create a **220 x 265 px** shape - the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.

##Step 3

Download [this image](http://pixabay.com/en/sunset-landscape-assam-india-169925/) and bring it inside your document using the **Photos Tool**. 

Make sure that your image stays selected, focus on the right side of your Titlebar and tap that ruler icon to open the **Geometry** panel. Check the **Constrain width and height** button (highlighted in the following image) and then enter **200 px** in the **Height** box. This will simply resize your image without messing the proportions. Place your image  exactly as shown in the first image. 

Get back to your Toolbar, select the fill and replace the existing color with a simple white (**R=255 G=255 B=255**). Pick the **Rectangle Tool**, create a **200 px** square and place it exactly as shown in the second image.
