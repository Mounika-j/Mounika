In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a simple clock illustration in Graphic for Mac. 

For starters you will learn how to set up and simple grid, how to create the main shapes and how to easily center them. Using two tiny paths and some neat rotation tricks you will learn how to create the clock grid. 

Finally, taking full advantage of the Effects pane, you will learn how to add shading and some sleek highlights for your shapes. 





##Step 1

Go to **File &gt; New (Command + N)** to bring up the **New Document** window. Select the **Grid** document style, set the document units to **pixels**, and set the document dimensions to **600** pixels wide by **600** pixels high.
Next, we'll set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. If the **Properties** panel is not currently visible, you can easily open it using the ruler icon that lies above the **Layers** panel. Change the grid **X Spacing** and **Y Spacing** to **5**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0** and enable **Snap to Grid (Command + Shift + ')**.

Keep in mind that you can quickly enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature using the  **Command +  '** and  **Command + Shift + '** keyboard shortcuts.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and  notice that by default the **Fill** color is set to white while the **Stroke** color is set to black. Click  the **Fill** color well and set it to **R=0 G=152 B=245** and then click the **Stroke** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this will simply make your **Stroke** invisible. 

Pick the **Ellipse Tool (O)**, move to your canvas and  create a **190 px** circle - the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work. Hold the **Shift** key while dragging to create a perfect circle.

##Step 3

Make sure that your circle is still selected and go to the **Alignment** pane from the **Properties** panel. Simply click the **Horizontal Centers** and **Vertical Centers** buttons to move your selected shape in the center of the canvas.

##Step 4

Return to your **Toolbar** and replace the existing **Fill** color with **R=0 G=90 B=150**. Pick the **Ellipse Tool (L)**, create a **180 px** circle and center it using the same **Horizontal Centers** and **Vertical Centers** buttons from the **Alignment** pane.

##Step 5

Get back to your **Toolbar** and replace the existing **Fill** color with **R=255 G=251 B=229**. Make sure that the **Ellipse Tool (L)** is still active, create a **170 px** circle and center it.

##Step 6

Return  to your **Toolbar** and replace the existing **Fill** color with **R=55 G=54 B=65**. Using the **Ellipse Tool (L)**, create a **10 px** circle and don't forget to center it.

##Step 7

Get back to your **Toolbar**. This time make sure that the **Fill**  is invisible and then set the **Stroke** color to **R=104 G=104 B=115**. 

Focus on the top side of your shapes and pick the **Pen Tool (P)** or the **Line Tool (L)**. Create a **5 px**, vertical path and place it exactly as shown in the following image. Once again, the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will come in handy. 

Make sure that your little path stays selected and go to the **Stroke** pane from the **Appearance** panel. Set the **Line Weight** to **1 px** and check that **Round Cap** button.  If the **Appearance** panel is not currently visible, you can easily open it using the leftmost icon that lies above the **Layers** panel.

##Step 8

Make sure that your vertical path stays selected, pick the **Rotate Tool (R**) and you will notice a tiny cross icon in the center of the selection. That's the reference point and keep in mind that your selected path will rotate according to that point. 

Simply drag that cross in the center of your dark circle (the **Snap to Grid** will ease your work)  and then focus on the tool options bar. Set the **Angle** to **6 degrees** and then click that **Copy** button a bunch of times (fifty-nine times, to be more specific). 

(image: clockIllustration8.jpg)



##Step 9

Reselect all your tiny paths, focus on the **Path Tools** pane from the **Properties** panel and click that **Make Compound Path** button. This will simply unite all selected paths into a single compound path that can be selected/edited a lot easier.

##Step 10

Return to your **Toolbar** and replace the existing **Stroke** color with **R=55 G=54 B=65**. 

Pick the **Pen Tool (P)** or the **Line Tool (L)**, create a **10 px**, vertical path and place it exactly as shown in the following image. Make sure that it stays selected and focus on the **Stroke**  pane. Set the **Line Weight** to **2 pt** and check the **Round Cap** button.  

(image: clockIllustration10.jpg)



##Step 11

Make sure that your **10 px**, vertical path stays selected and pick the **Rotate Tool (R**). Simply drag that reference point in the center of your dark circle  then focus on the **Tool Options** bar. Set the **Angle** to **30 degrees** then click that **Copy** button eleven times. Select all twelve paths and turn them into a new compound path using that same **Make Compound Path** button from the **Path Tools**  pane.

##Step 12

Get back to your **Toolbar** and replace the existing **Stroke** color with **R=7 G=114 B=179**. 

Pick the **Pen Tool (P)**, create a **65 px**, vertical path and place it as shown in the first image.  Make sure that this new path stays selected and focus on the **Stroke**  pane. Set the **Line Weight** to **2 px** and check the **Round Cap** button. 

Switch to the **Rotate Tool (R)**, drag the reference point in the the center of your dark circle and then rotate your blue path as shown in the third image.

##Step 13

Pick the **Pen Tool (P)**, create an **80 px**, horizontal path and place it as shown in the first image. Make sure that this new, blue path stays selected and focus the **Stroke** pane. Set the **Line Weight** to **2 pt** and check that **Round Cap** button. Switch to the **Rotate Tool (R)**, drag the reference point in the the center of your dark circle and then rotate your path as shown in the second image. 

Get back to your **Toolbar** and replace the existing **Stroke** color with **R=219 G=65 B=0**. 

Make sure that the **Pen Tool (P)** is still active, create a **90 px**, horizontal path and place it as shown in the third image. Make sure that this new path stays selected and return to the **Stroke** pane. Set the **Line Weight** to **2 pt** and don't forget to check that **Round Cap** button. Finally, switch to the **Rotate Tool (R)** and rotate this orange path as shown in the fourth image.

##Step 14

Select your largest circle, focus on the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel and simply check the  box that stands for the existing **Drop Shadow** to activate it. 

Enter **-1** in the **Y** box and **0** in the other two boxes and then click the color well that stands for this effect. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **5%** and make sure that the color is set to black ( **R=0 G=0 B=0**).
