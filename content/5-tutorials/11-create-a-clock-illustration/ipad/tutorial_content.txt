In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a simple clock illustration in Graphic for iPad. 

For starters you will learn how to setup and simple grid, how to create the main shapes and how to easily center them. Using two tiny paths and some neat rotation tricks you will learn how to create the clock grid.
 
Finally, taking full advantage of the Effects pane, you will learn how to add shading and some sleek highlights for your shapes. 





##Step 1

From the **Documents Browser**, tap the plus button at the top-left corner of the **Titlebar** and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. Go to the **Canvas** pane, set the **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and make sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled.

Next, you need to setup the document grid. Tap again that **Settings** icon and switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open that **Grid Settings** pane, enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and   notice that by default the **Fill** color is set to white while the **Line** color is set to black. Tap the **Fill** color well and set its color to **R=0 G=124 B=215** and then tap the **Line** color well. Drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and this  will simply make your **Line** invisible. 

Pick the **Ellipse  Tool**, move to your canvas and  create a **190 px** circle - the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work. Hold the **Shift** key while dragging to create a perfect circle. Tap and drag and then tap and hold with a second finger to easily create a perfect circle.

##Step 3

Make sure that your circle is still selected, focus on the right side of your Titlebar and tap that middle icon. Focus on the Arrange pane and simply tap the **Align Horizontal ** and **Align Vertical** buttons to move your selected shape in the center of the canvas.

##Step 4

Return to your **Toolbar** and replace the existing **Fill** color with **R=0 G=90 B=150**. Pick the **Ellipse Tool**, create a **180 px** circle and center it using the same **Horizontal Centers** and **Vertical Centers** buttons from the **Alignment** pane.

##Step 5

Get back to your **Toolbar** and replace the existing **Fill** color with **R=255 G=251 B=229**. Make sure that the **Ellipse Tool** is still active, create a **170 px** circle and center it.

##Step 6

Focus on the right side of your Titlebar and tap the rightmost icon to open the **Layers** panel. First, tap the name of the existing layer and rename it &quot;_Main_&quot;. Next, tap the plus button from the top, right corner of your panel to add a second layer. Select this new layer and rename it &quot;_handsConnector_&quot;. Make sure that this second layer stays selected and close the Layers panel. 

Rreturn  to your **Toolbar** and replace the existing **Fill** color with **R=55 G=54 B=65**. Using that same **Ellipse Tool**, create a **10 px** circle and don't forget to center it.

##Step 7

Re-open the **Layers** pane, add a third layer, make sure that it goes in the top of the panel and rename it &quot;_thinGrid_&quot;. Make sure that this new layer stays selected and close the **Layers** panel. 

Return to your **Toolbar**, tap that **Fill** color well and  drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** and then tap on the Line color well. Replace the existing color with **R=104 G=104 B=115** and drag the **Alpha** slider to **100%**. 

Focus on the top side of your shapes and pick the **Pen Tool** or the **Line Tool**. Create a **5 px**, vertical path and place it exactly as shown in the following image. Once again, the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will come in handy. Make sure that this tiny path stays selected, focus on the right side of your Titlebar and tap the leftmost icon. Move to the **Effects** pane and tap the existing **Stroke**. Make sure that the  **Width** is set to **1 pt** and check that **Round Cap** button.

##Step 8
Make sure that your **5 px**, vertical path stays selected, pick the **Rotate Tool** and you will notice a little cross icon in the center of your selection. That's the reference point and keep in mind that your selected path will rotate according to that point. 

Simply tap in the center of your dark circle and your reference point will snap there thanks to he **Snap to Grid** feature. Now, focus on that **Tool Options** pane, set the **Angle** to **6 degrees** and then tap that **Copy** button a bunch of times (fifty-nine times, to be more specific).

##Step 10

Simply drag that reference point in the center of your dark circle  and then focus on that **Tool Options** pane. Set the **Angle** to **30 degrees** and then tap that **Copy** button eleven times. Select all these twelve paths and turn them into a new compound path using that same **Make Compound Path** button from the **Combine**  pane.

##Step 12

Pick the **Pen Tool** or the **Line Tool**, create a **65 px**, vertical path and place it as shown in the first image.  Make sure that this new path stays selected and focus on the **Effects** pane.

Switch to the **Rotate Tool**, move the reference point in the the center of your dark circle and then rotate your path as shown in the second image.
