In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a flat contacts book icon in Graphic for Mac. 

For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create the main shapes using basic tools and vector shape building techniques. Next, you will learn how to add color and subtle effects for these shapes using mostly the Effects pane. Finally, you will learn how to add some simple text for your design.





##Step 1

For this tutorial we'll create a **600 x 600 px** document. Go to **File &gt; New (Command + N)** to bring up the **New Document** panel. Select the **Grid** document style and set the document units to **pixels**. Set the document dimensions to **600** pixels wide by **600** pixels high and then click **Choose** to create your document. 

Next, we'll adjust the document grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. You can easily open or close the **Properties** panel using that ruler icon. Change the **X** &amp; **Y Spacing** to **5**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0** and don't forget to enable **Snap to Grid** — all these features will make your work easier.

Keep in mind that you can quickly enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature using the  **Command +  '** and the  **Command + Shift + '** keyboard shortcuts.

##Step 2

Focus on your **Toolbar**, click  the **Fill** color well and set the  color to **R=181 G=137 B=65** . Click the **Stroke** color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**  to simply make your **Stroke** invisible. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)**, focus on the **Tool Options** bar and drag the **Corner Radius** slider to **10 pt**. 

Move to your canvas and create a **130 x 135 px** shape — the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.

##Step 3

Return to your **Toolbar**, make sure that the **Stroke** is still invisible and  set the **Fill** color to **R=29 G=119 B=180**. 

Reselect the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)**, create a **130 x 50 px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the following image. Use the grid that lies in the back as a reference.

##Step 4

Make sure that your blue, rounded rectangle is selected and add a copy in the same place using the **Command + C &gt; Command + Shift + V** keyboard shortcut. 

Using the **Move Tool (V)**, select this copy and drag it **5 px** up as shown in the following image. Holding the **Shift** key, select both blue shapes. Go to the **Path Tools** pane from the **Properties** panel and click the **Subtract** command. The resulting shape should look like in the second image.

##Step 5

Return to your **Toolbar**, make sure that the **Stroke** is still invisible and  set the **Fill** color to **R=255 G=185 B=0**. 

Using the **Rectangle Tool (M)**, create a **15 px** square and place it as shown in the following image.

##Step 6

Reselect your yellow square along with the blue shapes, focus on the **Path Tools** pane and click the **Subtract** command. The resulting blue shape should look like in the second image.

##Step 7

Duplicate your blue shape using the **Command + C &gt; Command + V** keyboard shortcut, select the copy and place it as shown in the following image. Once again, the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will come in handy.

##Step 8
Get back to your **Toolbar**. This time make  the **Fill**  invisible and set the **Stroke** color to **R=29 G=119 B=180**. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)**, create a **25 x 20 px** shape and place it as shown in the following image. Make sure that this new shape stays selected and focus on the **Effects** pane from the **Appearance** panel – click the leftmost inspector panel icon to open or close the **Appearance** panel whenever you want.

Click  the existing **Stroke** to expand it, drag that **Width** slider to **5 pt** and set the **Position** to **Inside**.

Return to your **Toolbar**, make sure that the **Stroke** is invisible and  set the **Fill** color to white (**R=255 G=255 B=255**). 

Using the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)**, create a **100 x 45 px** shape and place it as shown in the first image. Add a copy of this new shape in the same place (**Command + C &gt; Shift + Command + V**) and then drag it **10 px** up as shown in the second image. 

Select both shapes made in this step, focus on the **Path Tools** pane and click the **Subtract** command. Your resulting shape should look like in the third image.

##Step 15

Return to your **Toolbar**, make sure that the **Stroke** is invisible and  set the **Fill** color to black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**). 

Pick the **Rectangle Tool (M)**, create a **25 x 135 px** shape and place it as shown in the first image. Select your brown rounded rectangle and add a copy in the same place (**Command + C &gt; Shift + Command + V**). 

Select this fresh copy along with your black rectangle, focus on the **Path Tools** pane and click the **Intersect** command. In the end your black shape should look like in the third image.

##Step 16

Make sure that your black shape is still selected and focus on the **Effects** pane. Drag that **Opacity** slider to **50%** and set the **Blend Mode** to **Soft Light**. 

Move to the **Layers** pane, expand the existing layer and drag your black shape below the blue  and  the white ones.
