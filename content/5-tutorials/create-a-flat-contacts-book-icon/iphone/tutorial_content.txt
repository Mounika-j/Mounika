In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a flat contacts book icon in Graphic for iPhone. 

For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create the main shapes using basic tools and vector shape building techniques. Next, you will learn how to add color and subtle effects for these shapes using mostly the Effects pane. Finally, you will learn how to add some simple text for your design.





##Step 1

Start by tapping the   plus button from the top-left corner of your screen to create a new document. Tap the **Create Document** button and then choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar**, tap that ruler icon to open the **Properties** panel, and then tap the **Canvas** pane. 

Set both **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and be sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled. When this setting is enabled, stroked objects are offset slightly to ensure that the stroke is drawn aligned to the pixel grid which guarantees a crisp look.

Open the **Properties** panel and this time tap the **Grid** pane. 

Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid** feature. Finally, open the **Grid Settings** pane, enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on your **Toolbar**, tap  the **Fill** color well and set the  color to **R=181 G=137 B=65**. Tap the **Line** color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** to  simply make your **Line** invisible. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, focus on that **Tool Options** pane and drag the  **Radius** slider to **10**. 

Move to your canvas and create a **130 x 135 px** shape — the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.

##Step 3

Return to your **Toolbar**, make sure that the **Line** is still invisible and  set the **Fill** color to **R=29 G=119 B=180**. 

Reselect the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, create a **130 x 50 px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the following image. Use the grid that lies in the back as a reference.

##Step 4

Pick the **Move Tool**, select your blue shape and simply tap and hold to open that context menu. Tap the **Copy** command and then reopen that context menu. This time tap the **Paste in Place** command to add a copy of your blue shape in the same place. Using the **Move Tool**, select this  copy and drag it **5 px** up as shown in the following image. 

Switch to the **Path Selection Tool**, focus on the newly opened **Tool Options** pane and activate the **Add to Selection** mode. Select both blue shapes, open the **Combine** pane from the **Properties** panel and tap the **Subtract** command. The resulting shape should look like in the second image.

Make sure that this new shape stays selected and use the same **Copy** and **Paste in Place** commands to add a copy of your selection in the same place. Using the **Move Tool**, select this copy and drag it **10 px** up as shown in the second image.
