In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a flat contacts book icon in Graphic for iPad. 

For starters you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create the main shapes using basic tools and vector shape building techniques. Next, you will learn how to add color and subtle effects for these shapes using mostly the Effects pane. Finally, you will learn how to add some simple text for your design.





##Step 1

From the **Documents Browser**, tap the plus button at the top-left corner of the **Titlebar** and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. In the **Canvas** pane set the **Width** and the **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base units, and verify that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is disabled. When this setting is enabled, stroked objects are offset slightly to ensure that the stroke is drawn aligned to the pixel grid which guarantees a crisp look.

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Tap again that **Settings** icon and switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** pane. 

Be sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid** feature.  Open the **Grid Settings** pane, enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on your **Toolbar**, tap  the **Fill** color well and set the  color to **R=181 G=137 B=65** . Tap the **Line** color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** to  simply make your **Line** invisible. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, focus on that **Tool Options** pane and drag the  **Radius** slider to **10**. 

Move to your canvas and create a **130 x 135 px** shape — the grid and the **Snap to Grid** feature will ease your work.

##Step 3

Return to your **Toolbar**, make sure that the **Line** is still invisible and  set the **Fill** color to **R=29 G=119 B=180**. 

Reselect the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, create a **130 x 50 px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the following image. Use the grid that lies in the back as a reference.

##Step 4

Pick  the **Move Tool** and  select your blue shape. Focus on the left side of your **Titlebar** and tap that paperclip icon to open the **Edit** pane. Use the **Copy** and the **Paste in Place** commands to add a copy of your blue shape in the same place. Using the **Move Tool**, select this  copy and drag it **5 px** up as shown in the following image. 

Switch to the **Path Selection Tool**, focus on the newly opened **Tool Options** pane and activate the **Add to Selection** mode. Select both blue shapes, focus on the right side of your **Titlebar** and tap that middle icon. Move to the **Combine** pane and simply tap the **Subtract** command. The resulting shape should look like in the second image.
