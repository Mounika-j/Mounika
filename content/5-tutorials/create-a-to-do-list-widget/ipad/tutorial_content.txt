In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a to do list widget in Graphic for iPad. 

First, you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create a smooth radial gradient that will serve as a background. Next, you'll make the main shapes using mainly the Rounded Rectangle Tool and the Effects pane. Using the Line Tool, that same Rounded Rectangle Tool, the Ellipse Tool and some basic vector shape building techniques you will learn how to create a bunch of tiny icons. 

Finally, you will learn how to add some simple pieces of text. 





##Step 1

For this tutorial we'll create a new **600 x 600 pixel** document. From the **Documents Browser**, tap the plus button at the top-right corner of the **Titlebar** and choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar** and tap the **Settings** icon. Go to the **Canvas** panel, set the **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base units, and verify that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is enabled. The **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature ensures that all shapes which are aligned to the pixel grid will have solid, crisp strokes.

Next, we'll set up the document grid, so switch to the **Grid &amp; Rulers** panel. Make that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid or the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, simply tap the **Grid Spacing** pane to move to the **Grid Settings** pane. Enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in that one **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and you will notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the line color is set to black. Keep the white fill, but tap on the line color wheel and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** which will simply make the line invisible. 

Using the **Rectangle Tool**, create a **600 px** square, make sure that it stays selected and then focus on the right side of your Titlebar and tap the leftmost icon. Move to the **Effects** panel and tap the existing **Fill**. Tap the **Gradient Fill** and **Radial** buttons, set the **Angle** to **0 degrees** then move to the gradient sliders. 

Select the left one and set its color at **R=0 G=74 B=124** then select the right one and se its color at **R=0 G=43 B=94**. Switch to the **Move Tool** and simply double tap inside this square to activate that **Gradient Tool**.  Select the right gradient slider and drag it to the right roughly as shown in the following image. Tap and hold with a second finger while dragging  to easily keep your gradient line perfectly straight.
