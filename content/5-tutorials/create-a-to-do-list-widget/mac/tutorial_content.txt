In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a to do list widget in Graphic for Mac. 

First, you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create a smooth, radial gradient that will serve as a background. Next, you'll make the main shapes using mainly the Rounded Rectangle Tool and the Effects pane. Using the Line Tool, that same Rounded Rectangle Tool, the Ellipse Tool and some basic vector shape building techniques you will learn how to create a bunch of tiny icons. 

Finally, you will learn how to add some simple text fields.





##Step 1

For this tutorial we'll create a new **600 x 600 pixel** document. Choose **File &gt; New (Command + N)** to bring up the **New Document** panel. Select the **Grid** document style, set the document units to **pixels**, and set the document dimensions to **600** pixels wide by **600** pixels high.

Next, we'll set up the document grid. Switch to the **Grid** pane in the **Properties** panel. If the **Properties** panel is not currently visible, you can click on the  ruler icon above the **Layers** pane to show and hide the panel. Change the grid **X Spacing** and **Y Spacing** to **5px**, set the **Subdivisions** to **0px**, and enable **Snap to Grid (Command + Shift + ')**.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and you will notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the stroke color is set to black. Keep the white fill, but click on the stroke color well and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%**, which will simply make the stroke invisible. 

Using the **Rectangle Tool (M)**, create a **600 px** square and focus on the **Effect** pane from the **Appearance** pane. If the **Appearance** panel is not currently visible, you can click on the leftmost icon that lies above the **Layers** panel to show and hide the pane. 

Focus on the existing **Fill**, select **Radial Gradient** from the **Type** drop-down menu, set the **Angle** to **0 degrees** and then move to the gradient sliders. Select the left one and set its color at **R=0 G=74 B=124** and then select the right one and set its color at **R=0 G=43 B=94**. 

Switch to the **Move Tool (V)** and simply double click inside your square to activate the **Gradient Tool**. Select the right gradient slider and drag it to the right roughly as shown in the following image.

##Step 3

Make sure that your square is still selected, move to the **Alignment** pane from the **Properties** panel and simply click the **Horizontal Centers** and **Vertical Centers** buttons to move your square in the center of the canvas.

##Step 18

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool (Shift + M)**, focus on the tool options bar and drag the **Corner Radius** slider at **1pt**. 

Move to your canvas, create a **10  px** rounded square  and place it as shown in the following image. Make sure that this tiny rounded rectangle stays selected and focus on the **Effect** pane from the **Appearance** panel. Focus on the existing **Stroke**, select **Outside** from the **Position** drop-down menu and simply drag the **Width** slider at **2pt**. Also, click the color wheel that stands for this stroke and set the color to **R=205 G=205 B=205**.

##Step 22

Return to your **Toolbar**, make  the **Stroke** is invisible and then set the **Fill** color to **R=205 G=205 B=205**. 

Using the **Ellipse Tool (O)**, create a **10 px** circle and place it as shown in the following image. 

(image: toDoListWidget22.jpg)



##Step 23


Now, you will need a grid every **1 px** which simply means that you need to return to the **Grid**  pane from the **Properties** panel and enter **1 px** in both  **Spacing** boxes. 

Keep focusing  on the tiny circle made in the previous step and pick the **Rectangle Tool (M)**. Create a **4 x 3 px** shape and place it exactly as shown in the following image. Focus on the top side of this new rectangle and switch to the **Path Selection Tool (A)**. 

First, select the right anchor point and simply remove it using the **Delete** button from your keyboard and then select the left anchor point and drag it **2 px** to the right. In the end your  rectangle should turn into a simple triangle as shown in the second image.

##Step 26

For the final steps you will need a grid every **1 px** which so return to the **Grid**  pane from the **Properties** pane and enter **1 px** in both  **Spacing** boxes. 

Return to your **Toolbar**, make sure that the **Stroke** is invisible and then set the **Fill** color to **R=123 G=185 B=210**. 

Pick the **Rectangle Tool (M)**, create a **4 x 2** and a **2 x 5px** shapes and then place them as shown in the first two images. Select these tiny, new rectangles, focus on the **Path Tools** pane from the **Properties** panel and click the **Union** button. Make sure that the resulting shape is selected, simply rotate it **-45 degrees** and place it as shown in the fourth image.
