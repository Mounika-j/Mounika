In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a to do list widget in Graphic for iPhone. 

First, you will learn how to setup a simple grid and how to create a smooth radial gradient that will serve as a background. Next, you'll make the main shapes using mainly the Rounded Rectangle Tool and the Effects pane. Using the Line Tool, that same Rounded Rectangle Tool, the Ellipse Tool and some basic vector shape building techniques you will learn how to create a bunch of tiny icons. 

Finally, you will learn how to add some simple pieces of text. 





##Step 1

Start by tapping the   plus button from the top-left corner of your screen to create a new document. Tap the **Create Document** button and then choose the **Grid** document style.

Focus on the right side of the **Titlebar**, tap that ruler icon to open the **Properties** panel and then tap the **Canvas** pane. Set both **Width** and **Height** to **600 px**, select **Pixels** for the base unit, and be sure that the **Pixel-Align Strokes** feature is enabled. This feature ensures that all shapes that are aligned to the pixel grid will have solid, crisp strokes.

Re-open the **Properties** panel and tap the **Grid** pane. Make sure that the **Snap to Grid** feature is enabled and keep in mind that this is where you should come whenever you wish to enable or disable the grid and the **Snap to Grid**. Finally, open the **Grid Settings** pane and enter **5 px** in both **Spacing** boxes and **0 lines** in the **Subdivisions** box.

##Step 2

Focus on the **Toolbar** and you will notice that by default the fill color is set to white while the line color is set to black. Keep the white fill, but tap  the line color wheel and drag the **Alpha** slider to **0%** which will simply make the line invisible. 

Using the **Rectangle Tool**, create a **600 px** square, make sure that it stays selected and return to your **Toolbar**. Re-open the fill color panel and tap the **Gradient** button. Set the **Angle** to **0 degrees**, check the **Radial Gradient** icon and then move to the gradient sliders. 

Select the left one and set its color at **R=0 G=74 B=124** then select the right one and se its color at **R=0 G=43 B=94**. Switch to the **Move Tool** and simply double tap inside your square to activate that **Gradient Tool**. Select the right gradient slider and drag it to the right roughly as shown in the following image. Tap and hold with a second finger while dragging  to easily keep your gradient line perfectly straight.

First of all, be sure that the layer added in the previous step is still selected. Return to your **Toolbar**, make sure that the **Stroke** is still invisible and then set the **Fill** color to **R=245 G=247 B=243**. 

Pick the **Rounded Rectangle Tool**, focus on the newly opened tool pane and drag the  **Radius** slider to **5**. Move to your canvas, create a **235 x 230 px** shape and place it roughly in the center of the canvas.

##Step 6

Make sure that your rounded rectangle stays selected, keep focusing on the **Effects**  pane and add a second **Stroke** using the plus button located in the top, right corner of the pane. 

Select this new **Stroke**, drag it below the existing one and then enter the attributes shown in the following image. You can easily move  attributes from the **Effects** pane using that button made out of  three horizontal lines that  comes with every attribute.
