Depending on the base measurement unit set in the (link: docs-iphone/canvas/settings text: _**Canvas pane**_), you'll be able to choose from several levels of precision and abbreviations for your dimension label. 

A canvas with _**inches**_ set as the base unit of the document gives you the possibility to choose from: _in_, _ft_, _ft in_, _'' (in)_, _' (ft)_, _' '' (ft in)_, _yd_ and _mi_.

A canvas with _**millimeters**_ or _**centimeters**_ set as the base unit of the document gives you the possibility to choose from: _mm_, _cm_, _m_, _km_.

Working on intricate technical designs you might need extra precision for your dimension labels. Using the _**Precision**_ menu from the _**Label pane**_ you can add up to 4 digits after the decimal point. Instead of using decimal values, you can set your dimension labels to use fractional values: halves, quarters, 1/8, 1/16 or 1/32.

Labels also update when you're creating  (link: docs-iphone/canvas/settings#scale text: _’**to-scale**’_) technical designs. The displayed values will instantly update whenever you change one of the _**Scale**_ settings from the (link: docs-iphone/canvas/settings text: _**Canvas pane**_).
