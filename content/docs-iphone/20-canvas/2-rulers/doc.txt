# Rulers

Rulers allow you to visualize the coordinates of selected objects and to accurately position them on the canvas. To show or hide rulers, open the _**Grid pane**_ from the Properties panel and tap the _**Show Rulers**_ or _**Hide Rulers**_ command. Tapping the _**Auto-Hide Rulers**_ command will only make the rulers visible when an object is moved  or when you zoom it and out.

Rulers appear along the top and left side of your active document. The  0 point on each ruler is located at the top-left corner of your canvas. Markers on the rulers will highlight the position of any selected object.
