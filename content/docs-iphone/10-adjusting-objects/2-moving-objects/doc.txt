# Moving Objects

Choose the _**Move tool**_ to select and move objects or groups. Objects can be moved by tapping on them and dragging to a new position. If the object has no fill or if (link: docs-iphone/preferences#outline-mode text: _**Outline mode**_) is enabled, moving it is done by dragging its contour.

Tap and hold with a second finger while dragging to constrain the movement of the selected object to a single direction.

Objects can also be moved numerically using the _**Position**_ settings from the _**Geometry pane**_ of the Properties panel.
