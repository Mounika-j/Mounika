# Scaling Objects

Choose the _**Scale tool**_ to resize objects relative to a reference point.

To scale one or more objects, first select the objects to be scaled and choose the _**Scale tool**_. With the Scale tool active, tap and drag anywhere on the canvas to resize the selected objects.

Tap and hold with a second finger while resizing to scale the object,  horizontally, vertically or proportionally.
Tap and hold with a second and a third finger  while resizing to scale the object proportionally from the center of its bounding box.

Objects can also be scaled numerically using the _**Tool pane**_. Set the percent to scale vertically and horizontally and then tap _**Scale**_ to apply the scaling. Tapping _**Copy**_ will duplicate the objects first and then apply the scale transformation to the copied objects.

Alternatively, objects can be resized numerically using the _**Size**_ settings from the _**Geometry pane**_ of the Properties panel. To lock the aspect ratio while entering values, tap the aspect ratio lock icon.

By default, the reference point will be located in the center of the selected objects. To use a different location for the reference point, drag it or simply tap (without dragging) to set it at that new location.

Objects can also be resized manually using Move tool's _**bounding box**_.

Choose the _**Move tool**_ and make a selection. The blue draggable handles can be used to resize the currently selected objects in different directions. Tap and drag one of these handles to easily resize the objects.
