# Multiplying Objects

Objects or groups can be easily duplicated using the classic _**Copy**_ and _**Paste**_ commands. Select the objects youâ€™d like to duplicate and then tap and hold anywhere on the canvas until the context menu appears. Tap the _**Copy**_ command and then tap and hold again to reopen that context menu and tap the _**Paste**_ command.

Use the _**Paste in Place**_ command to add the copy in the same location of the original object.

The _**Select All**_ command will select all the shapes from your active layer. Using the _**Cut**_ command and subsequently the _**Paste**_ or _**Paste in Place**_ command, you can easily remove an object from a layer and paste it inside another layer.
