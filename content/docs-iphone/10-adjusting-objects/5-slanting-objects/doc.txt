# Slanting Objects

Choose the _**Shear tool**_ to slant objects relative to a reference point.

To slant one or more objects, first select the objects to be transformed and choose the _**Shear tool**_. With the Shear tool active, tap and drag anywhere on the canvas to slant the selected objects.

Tap and hold with a second finger while dragging to slant the selected objects on only one axis (horizontally or vertically).

Objects can also be slanted numerically using the _**Tool pane**_. Set the horizontal and vertical shear angles and then tap _**Shear**_ to apply the transformation. Tapping _**Copy**_ will duplicate the objects first and then apply the slant transformation to the copied objects.

By default, the reference point will be located in the center of the selected objects. To use a different location for the reference point, drag it or simply tap (without dragging) to set it at that new location.
