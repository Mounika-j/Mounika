## Toolbar

The _**Toolbar**_ allows you to choose between the various drawing and editing tools available in Graphic. There are nineteen tools divided in five groups. 

To select and use a tool simply tap on its icon in the _**Toolbar**_. If the desired tool is not visible, tap the group where it lies and then select it from that pop-up menu.

Some of these tools have customizable settings that can be adjusted in the _**Tool pane**_. Whenever you select a tool with customizable settings the _**Tool pane**_ pops-up in the bottom of your screen. 

Next to the tools are the (link: docs-iphone/colors text: _**Fill**_) and (link: docs-iphone/colors text: _**Line**_) color wells, which can be used to set the current stroke and fill settings. Selecting an object will show you it's fill and stroke attributes. If the selected object has more that one Fill/Stroke the color wells will only show the attributes of the front Fill/Stroke.
