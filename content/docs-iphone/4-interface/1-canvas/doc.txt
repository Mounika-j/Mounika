## Canvas

The Canvas is the visible area that defines a design. It is where illustrations are created; where objects are drawn and edited. 

The grey area surrounding the canvas is nonprintable ‘scratch’ space. Objects can overlap into this area, or they can be placed here while a design is being edited. However, anything outside of the canvas will not be visible when printing or exporting the design.
