## Interface

Graphic uses a primarily single-canvas interface, with a few accompanying inspector panes for additional settings and features. 

The (link: docs/interface/toolbar text: _**Toolbar**_) provides access to the available drawing and editing tools. The options in the (link: docs-iphone/interface/titlebar text: _**Titlebar**_) can be used to return to the ***Documents Browser***, undo/ redo actions, delete selected objects or open one of the four main settings panels.
