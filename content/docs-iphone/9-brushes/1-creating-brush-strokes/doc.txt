# Creating Brush Strokes

Choose the _**Brush tool**_ to create smooth brush strokes. Open the _**Brush pane**_ from the Appearance panel  and use those settings to make your brush strokes appear as if they were drawn using a calligraphic pen or paintbrush.

The _**Brush tool**_ has a smoothing setting which can be used to control the amount of smoothing applied to newly drawn brush strokes. Adjust the brush _**width**_ and the amount of _**smoothing**_ using the _**Tool pane**_ settings.
