# Blurs

The _**Blur**_ effect is used to blur any type of object. Changes are applied to the currently selected objects.

Tap any effect to get access to its properties.  As with the other attributes, multiple _**Blur**_ effects can be added to an object.

Use the blur slider to set the amount of blur applied to your selected shape. A higher blur value will result in a larger and blurrier object.

Blur effects can also be applied to objects with image fills.
