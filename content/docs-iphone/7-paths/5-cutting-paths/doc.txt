# Cutting Paths

The _**Pen tool**_ can also be used to cut paths. Use the settings in the _**Tool pane**_ to change the Pen tool from the default path creation mode, to the _**Cut Paths**_ mode.

Remember to first select the path to edit using the Move or Path Selection tools. After choosing the _**Cut Paths**_ mode, tap anywhere on the selected path to cut it.
