# Converting Path Points

Select the _**Path Selection tool**_ and choose the _**Convert mode**_ from the _**Tool pane**_ to easily convert path points to either smooth points (anchor points with direction handles) or corners (anchor points without direction handles).

To convert a corner point to a smooth point, tap on the point with the _**Convert mode**_ active and drag to create direction handles around the point.
