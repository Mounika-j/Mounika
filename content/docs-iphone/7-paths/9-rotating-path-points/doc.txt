# Rotating Path Points

Choose the _**Rotate tool**_ to rotate path points around a reference point.

To rotate one or more path points, first select the path points using the _**Path Selection tool**_. With the _**Rotate tool**_ active, tap and drag anywhere on the canvas to rotate the path points clockwise or counterclockwise.

Tap and drag to begin rotating the selected point, and then tap and hold with a second finger to constrain the rotation to 15Ëš increments.

Path points can also be rotated numerically using the _**Tool pane**_ settings. Set a rotation angle in the field and tap _**Rotate**_ to apply the rotation.

By default, the reference point will be located in the center of the selected object. To use a different location for the reference point, drag it or simply tap (without dragging) to set it at that new location.

> Tip: When (link: docs-iphone/canvas/snapping text: _**Snap to Grid**_) is enabled, tapping to move the reference point will snap it to the grid.
