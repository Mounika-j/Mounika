# Adding Path Points


The _**Pen tool**_ can also be used to add points to any path. Use the settings in the _**Tool pane**_ to change the Pen tool from the default path creation mode, to the _**Add Points**_ mode.

Remember to first select the path to edit using the Move or Path Selection tools. After choosing the _**Add Points**_ mode, simply tap anywhere on the selected path to add a new anchor point.

> Tip: When (link: docs-iphone/canvas/snapping text: _**Snap to Grid**_) is enabled, the added path points will snap to the grid.
