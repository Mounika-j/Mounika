# Image Tool

Use the _**Image tool**_ to scale and position an image fill inside of a shape’s bounds, cropping the image non-destructively.

Choose the _**Move tool**_ and tap an object with an image fill to select it, and then tap it a second time to activate the _**Image Tool**_. The edges of the image will appear on the selected shape.

The image can be scaled using the _**Image**_ slider from the _**Tool pane**_. Simply drag your image to change its position within the shape’s bounds. 

To reset the image’s size and position to the defaults, tap the _**Reset**_ button in the _**Tool pane**_.
