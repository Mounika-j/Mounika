### Grouping Documents

Documents can be kept as separate files or grouped inside folders. To create a folder, simply drag one document on top of another. Tap and hold on a document’s thumbnail until it ‘pops up’ to begin dragging. When one document is being dragged on top of another, a dark outline will appear to show the drop target. Once you lift your finger, a new folder will be created with these two documents.

New documents can be added or removed from a folder using the same tap, hold and drag technique. 

To rename a folder, simply tap on its name and make the changes.
