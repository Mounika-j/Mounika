When creating a new document, you will be presented with a variety of canvas styles to choose from â€“ including graph paper, notebook paper, and blueprint. 

All canvas styles are created using variations of the built-in grid and background settings, making them fully customizable. Customize your document further using the (link: docs-iphone/canvas/settings text: _**Canvas**)_ and (link: docs-iphone/canvas/grid text: _**Grid**_) panes.
