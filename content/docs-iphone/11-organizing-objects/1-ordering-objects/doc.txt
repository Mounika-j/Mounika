# Ordering Objects

Objects are stacked inside the active layer, beginning with the first object drawn. The stacking determines how objects will display when they overlap.

The stacking order of your objects can be changed at any time using the _**Arrange**_ command from the _**Properties panel**_. Simply dragging that slider you can:

**Bring to Front** - Drag the slider to the right end to move your selected object/group to front/top of the stack.
