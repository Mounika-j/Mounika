# Boolean Commands

Boolean commands create new paths by combining the shapes of multiple closed paths in different ways. All commands can be found in the _**Combine pane**_.

There are five different boolean commands to choose from. The resulting shape will keep the appearance attributes of the rearmost selected shape. Having two overlapping shapes selected, these will be the results:

**Union** - Creates only one shape composed of the selected shapes.

**Subtract** - Creates a new shape, removing the top shapes and the overlapping areas.
