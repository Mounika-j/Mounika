# Rotating Objects

Choose the _**Rotate tool**_ to rotate objects around a reference point.

To rotate one or more objects, first select the objects to be rotated and then choose the _**Rotate tool**_. With the Rotate tool active, tap and drag anywhere on the canvas to rotate the objects clockwise or counterclockwise.

Tap and hold with a second finger while dragging to constrain the rotation to 15˚ increments.

Objects can also be rotated numerically using the _**Tool pane**_. Set a rotation angle in the field and tap _**Rotate**_ to apply the rotation. Tapping _**Copy**_ will duplicate the objects first and then apply the rotation to the copied objects.

Alternatively, objects can be rotated numerically using the _**Rotation**_ settings from the _**Geometry pane**_.

Tap the _**Rotate 90° Clockwise**_ or the _**Rotate 90° Couter-Clockwise**_ buttons from the _**Geometry pane**_ to quickly rotate objects by 90˚.

By default, the reference point will be located in the center of the selected objects. To use a different location for the reference point, drag it or simply tap (without dragging) to set it at that new location.

Objects can also be rotated manually using Move tool's _**bounding box**_.

Choose the _**Move tool**_ and make a selection. The orange draggable handles at the sides of the bounding box can be used to rotate the selected objects. Tap and drag one of these handles to easily rotate objects.
