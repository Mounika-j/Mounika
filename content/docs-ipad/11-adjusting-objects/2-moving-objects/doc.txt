# Moving Objects

Choose the _**Move tool**_ to select and move objects or groups. Objects can be moved by tapping on them and dragging to a new position. If the object has no fill or if (link: http://www.graphic.com/docs-ipad/preferences#outline-mode text: _**Outline mode**_) is enabled, moving it is done by dragging its contour.

Tap and hold with a second finger while dragging to constrain the movement of the selected object to a single direction.

Objects can also be moved numerically using the _**Position**_ settings from the _**Geometry pane**_.

The displayed _**Position**_ settings are based on the reference point that's set in the  _**Geometry pane**_. Tap the _**Reference Point**_ button to set a different reference point. Select the top-left reference point and the _**Position**_ settings will display the location for the top-right corner of your selection.
