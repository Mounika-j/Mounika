# Gradient Tool

Use the _**Gradient tool**_ to position the start and end points of a gradient fill relative to a shape’s bounds, changing the angle and spread of the gradient.

Choose the _**Move tool**_ and tap an object with a gradient fill to select it, and then tap it a second time to activate the _**Gradient tool**_. The start and end points of the gradient will appear on the selected shape.

The gradient handles can be moved by simply dragging them. Tap and hold with a second finger while dragging the gradient handle to constrain its movement to 45˚ increments.

To reset the start and end points of the gradient to their default positions, tap the _**Reset**_ button in the _**Tool pane**_.

When finished, tap anywhere on the canvas to end the gradient editing and revert to the _**Move tool**_.
