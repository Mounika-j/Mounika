# Gradient Palette

Use the _**Gradient palette**_  to quickly choose a gradient, as well as save and reuse frequently used gradients. 

Gradients can be added to the _**Gradient palette**_ by dragging the gradient from the thumbnail to one of the palette slots. You can add new gradients inside empty slots or replace an existing gradient by dragging a new gradient on top of it. 

To delete a gradient from the _**Gradient palette**_, tap on it and hold to open the  context menu, and then tap the _**Remove**_ command.
