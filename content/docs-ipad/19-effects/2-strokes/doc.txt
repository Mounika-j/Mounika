# Strokes

The _**Stroke**_ attribute is used to adjust a path’s stroke color, width, and style. Changes are applied to the currently selected objects.

Tap any _**Stroke**_ to get access to its properties. As with the other attributes, multiple _**Strokes**_ can be added to an object.

### Stylizing strokes {#stylizing-strokes}

Additionally, the _**Stroke pane**_ from the Appearance panel can be used to adjust a stroke's style. Changes are applied to the currently selected objects. 

Besides the settings from the _**Effects pane**_, the _**Stroke pane**_ gives you the possibility to choose from a variety of line endings and preset line dash styles or to create custom line dash styles using the line style pop-ups.

Open the middle line style pop-up and tap the _**Custom Line Dash**_ button. Create a custom line dash style using the dash and gap fields. _**Dash**_ fields adjust the length of a dash, while _**Gap**_ fields adjust the space between dashes. The values used in these fields multiply according to the existing Width value. 

For example, a 10 pt line width with a 2 pt dash and a 3 pt  gap will create a dashed line with 20 px dashes and 30 px gaps.
