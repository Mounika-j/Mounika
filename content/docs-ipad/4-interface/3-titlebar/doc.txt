The _**Titlebar**_ offers quick shortcuts to the classic _**Save**_ the document, _**Save a Copy**_, _**Undo**_, _**Redo**_ and _**Delete**_ commands.

Tap the paperclip icon to open the _**Edit**_ pane. Use the _**Cut**_, _**Copy**_, _**Paste**_ and _**Paste in Place**_ commands to easily move content from one layer to another or to multiply objects. In addition to these classic commands, objects can be easily copied as PNG, PDF, SVG, CSS or Swift Code using the _**Copy As**_ commands. 

Use the _**Paste Inside**_ command to mask objects or the _**Style**_ commands to copy the style of an object and paste it to another. Instantly select all objects from a selected layer with the _**Select All**_ command and deselect them with the _**Select None **_ command.
