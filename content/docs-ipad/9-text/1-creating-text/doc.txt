# Creating Text

To create a new text field tap on the _**Text Tool**_ icon in the _**Toolbar**_. 

To add text inside a newly made text field double tap it and the keyboard will appear.  Using the _**Text Options pane**_ above the keyboard, you can set the font, style, size and alignment which should be used for the text that you are about to add.

Text fields have bounding boxes allowing you to easily move, rotate or resize them as you can with any other type of object. To deselect a text field tap anywhere on your canvas, outside the selected text field.

To change the properties of an existing text using the _**Text Options pane**_, you need to highlight the text before you make any changes. Double tap your text to enter text editing mode, then tap-and-hold to highlight it with the Select menu, then you can make the changes.
