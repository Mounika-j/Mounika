# Exporting

Once finished with a design, you can export it as an image or vector-based file. When ready to export, go back to the _**Documents Browser**_ and tap the _**Select**_ button. 

Tap on each document to select it and then tap the _**Share**_ button and select one of the export commands.

In addition to those formats, the _**Send to Email**_ and the _**Save to Dropbox**_ commands also offer the ability to export your documents as native Graphic files.

#{#export}

1. **Format** - Choose the file format to be used for the exported file. 

2. **Scale** - Optionally set a scale factor to size of the exported design. 

3. **Image Resolution** - Select the image resolution to be used for the exported file. 

4. **Include Background** - When this option is enabled, the grid and color set for the canvas background remain visible in the exported file. 
To export a design with a transparent background, disable this setting.

> Note: When exporting to a format that doesn’t support transparency (PDF and JPEG), a white background will be added to the files exported when ‘Include Background’ is disabled.
