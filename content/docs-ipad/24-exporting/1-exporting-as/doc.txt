# Exporting As

An alternative method that can be used to copy and export content made in Graphic is the _**Copy As**_ command from the _**Edit**_ panel. Using one of the five options you can export content as PNG, PDF, SVG code, CSS code or Swift Code. 


Copy logos, icons, buttons, intricate illustration or any kind of object or set of objects as a **PNG** image. Easily paste the new content inside a new document or in another app.

Copy any kind of object or set of objects as **SVG** code that can be pasted directly into HTML or CSS files. Graphic creates clean structured SVG syntax which can easily be edited by hand.
