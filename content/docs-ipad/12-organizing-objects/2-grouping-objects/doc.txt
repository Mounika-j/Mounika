# Grouping Objects

Several objects can be combined into a group. Groups can be easily manipulated together as a single object. Grouping objects can be useful when you are looking to transform several objects without affecting their attributes or relative positions.

Use the commands from the _**Properties panel**_ to group or ungroup multiple objects. Using one of the two commands you can:

_**Group**_ - Combines selected objects/groups into a group. Groups can also be grouped with other objects or groups.

_**Ungroup**_ - Removes the group and keeps the separate objects.

To select a single object from a group, choose the _**Move tool**_ and double tap on it.
