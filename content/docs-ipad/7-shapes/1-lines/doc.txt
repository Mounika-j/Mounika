Choose the _**Line tool**_ to draw line segments. Tap and drag to create a line segment. 

Besides creating plain lines, it can also be used to create _**arrowed lines**_ and _**dimension lines**_. The settings in the _**Tool pane**_ can be used to change the Line tool from the default _**Plain Line**_ mode, to the _**Arrowed Line**_ or _**Dimension Line**_ modes.
