Tap and drag to begin drawing an arrowed line, and then tap and hold with a second finger to easily create horizontal, vertical or 45Â° arrowed lines.

The line endings and the line dash styles for created lines can be customized using the (link: docs-ipad/effects/strokes#stylizing-strokes text: _**Stroke pane **_) from the Appearance panel. When creating lines with the _**Arrowed Line**_ mode, the previously selected line endings will be used.
