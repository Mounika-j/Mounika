Choose the _**Brush tool**_ to create calligraphic brush strokes which appear as if they were drawn using a calligraphic pen or paintbrush.

Activate the _**Use Pressure**_ feature to create pressure sensitive brushes with your Apple pencil.

The _**Brush tool**_ has a smoothing setting which can be used to control the amount of smoothing applied to newly drawn brush strokes. Adjust the brush _**width**_ and the amount of _**smoothing**_ using the _**Tool pane**_ settings.
