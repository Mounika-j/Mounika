# Image Tool

Use the _**Image tool**_ to scale and position an image fill inside of a shape’s bounds, cropping the image non-destructively.

Choose the _**Move tool**_ and tap an object with an image fill to select it, and then tap it a second time to activate the _**Image tool**_.

The image can be scaled using the _**Image Scale**_ slider or by dragging the bottom-right corner of the applied image. Simply drag your image to change its position within the shape’s bounds.

To reset the image’s size and position to the defaults, tap the _**Reset**_ button in the _**Tool pane**_. 

When finished, tap anywhere on the canvas to end editing and revert to the _**Move tool**_.
