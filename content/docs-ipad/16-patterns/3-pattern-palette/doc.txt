# Pattern Palette

Use the _**Pattern palette**_  to quickly choose a pattern, as well as save and reuse frequently used patterns. 

Drag the pattern thumbnail to one of the palette slots to save the adjusted version of a pattern that's already saved in the _**Pattern palette**_. You can add new patterns inside empty slots or replace an existing pattern by dragging a new pattern on top of it.
