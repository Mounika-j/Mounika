# Pattern Tool

The _**Pattern tool**_ can be used to scale and position a pattern fill inside of a shape’s bounds.

Choose the _**Move tool**_ and tap an object with a pattern fill to select it, and then tap it a second time to activate the _**Pattern tool**_. 

The pattern can be scaled using the _**Pattern Scale**_ slider from the _**Tool pane**_ or positioned within the shape’s bounds by dragging.

To reset the pattern’s size and position to the defaults, tap the _**Reset**_ button in the _**Tool pane**_.
