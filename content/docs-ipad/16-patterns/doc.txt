# Patterns

Patterns consist of a tile repeated horizontally, vertically or at an angle. Patterns can be used to stylize the _**Fill**_ of any object, even text.

Use the _**Pattern panel**_ to customize any type of pattern or to apply a pre-made pattern from the (link: docs-ipad/patterns/pattern-palette text: _**Pattern palette**_). Alternatively, you can use the _**Fill pane**_ or the (link: docs-ipad/effects text: _**Effects pane**_) from the Appearance panel.

Additionally, you can adjust the position and scale of your pattern using the (link: docs-ipad/patterns/pattern-tool text: _**Pattern tool**_).
