Title: Scaling Path Points

# Scaling Path Points

Choose the _**Scale tool**_ to scale path points around a reference point.

To scale one or more path points, first select the path points using the _**Path Selection tool**_. With the _**Scale tool**_ active, tap and drag anywhere on the canvas to scale the points around the reference point.

Tap and drag to begin scaling the selected point, and then tap and hold with a second finger to constrain the width, the height or both attributes while performing the scaling.

Path points can also be scaled numerically using the _**Tool pane**_ settings. Set the percent to scale vertically and horizontally, and then click _**Scale**_ to apply the scaling.

By default, the reference point will be located in the center of the selected object. To use a different location for the reference point, drag it or simply tap (without dragging) to set it at that new location.

> Tip: When (link: docs-ipad/canvas/snapping text: _**Snap to Grid**_) is enabled, tapping to move the reference point will snap it to the grid.
