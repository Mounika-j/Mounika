# Appending an Existing Path

The _**Pen tool**_ can append additional segments to an existing unclosed path.

First, select the path to edit using the Move or Path Selection tools and then select the _**Pen tool**_. Tap one of the endpoints of the path to begin editing (or tap and drag to create a direction handle) and then start adding the new points or close the path.
