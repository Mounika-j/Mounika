# Path Commands

Path commands can be used to link separate paths, to connect end points, to open or close paths, or to expand strokes into editable vector paths. 

All these commands can be found in the _**Path pane**_ from the Properties panel.

**Join Paths** - Use this command to link two open paths together into a single continuous path. To join, select the two open paths, open the _**Path pane**_  and tap the _**Join Paths**_ command. The paths  will be joined at their nearest end points, with the path (link: docs-ipad/organizing-objects/ordering-objects text: _**furthest back**_) remaining in place.

**Connect Endpoints** - Use this command to link two open paths together into a single closed shape. To connect,  select the two open paths, open the _**Path pane**_ and tap the _**Connect Endpoints**_ command.  This will generate new paths connecting the end points of the selected paths.

**Disconnect Path** - Use this command to disconnect any type of path or shape. To disconnect,  select your shape or path, open the _**Path pane**_ and tap the _**Disconnect Path**_ command.  This will cut your shape and you will get all the path sections that make up your selected shape.

**Close Path** - Closing an open path will connect the pathâ€™s start and end points with a line segment. To close a path, select it, open the _**Path pane**_ and tap the _**Close Path**_ command.

**Reverse Path Direction** - Use this command to easily reverse the starting and the ending point of a selected path. To reverse a path's direction, select it, open the _**Path pane**_ and tap the _**Reverse Path Direction**_ command.

**Outline Stroke** - Use this command to convert the styled stroke of an object into an editable vector shape. To outline a stroke, select it, open the _**Path pane**_ and tap the _**Outline Stroke**_ command. If the target object also has a fill, the result will be a (link: docs-ipad/organizing-objects/grouping-objects text: _**group**_) containing both the previous fill and the converted stroke object.
