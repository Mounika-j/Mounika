# Editing Path Points

Choose the _**Path Selection tool**_ to select and modify the points and curves of a path. You can modify shapes by moving and deleting path points, and adjusting the curved sections of a path. Tap on an anchor point to select it and then drag to move it.

Tap and hold with a second and third finger on the canvas while dragging the anchor point to constrain the movement of your selection to the vertical or horizontal axis.

Direction handles that appear on either side of a selected anchor point control the curvature of the path at that location. Moving a direction handle will modify the shape of the curve at that anchor point.

Direction handles are shown as a filled circle with a line extending to the anchor point. Tap and drag a direction handle to modify a curve.

#### Selecting Multiple Points {#selectmultiple} 

Multiple points on a path can be selected and edited at the same time. To select multiple points, tap and drag on the canvas to create a selection marquee.

Alternatively, you can use the _**Add to Selection**_ mode. Activate it from the _**Tool pane**_ and then tap on each point. This can be very helpful when working with complex documents. 
Use the _**Add to Selection**_ mode to select multiple objects as well.

The _**Path Selection tool**_ can also be used to select multiple paths at once. However, to edit the anchor points of a path, only a single path (or compound path) should be selected.

#### Modifying Curves

Moving a direction handle with the _**Path Selection tool**_ will adjust the curvature of the path segment at a specific point. Anchor points with two direction handles, one at each side, are smooth points. Moving the direction handle on one side of these points will automatically move the opposite direction handle to maintain the smoothness of the curve at that point.

To create a sharper angle at an anchor point, move a single direction handle independently. Select an anchor point and then tap and hold with a second finger while dragging one of the direction handles. Alternatively, you can activate the _**Convert mode**_ from the _**Tool pane**_ and simply drag the direction handle. 

Select an anchor point and tap and hold with a second finger while dragging it to move the anchor point, but lock the position for the direction handles.
