2. **Include** - Select the content that your exported file should contain. 

 Select _**Entire Canvas**_ to include the grid and the background in your exported file. 

 Select _**All Objects**_ to export only your artwork. Using this option you can export a design with a transparent background. Only files in (link: docs/new-documents#colorMode text: _**RGB color mode**_) can be exported as PNG or TIFF with transparent background. Certain formats do not support transparent backgrounds, such as JPEG. When exporting to these formats, the background color will be white in transparent areas. 

 Select _**Selected Objects**_ to only export the objects selected before opening the _**Export**_ pop-up window.

3. **Scale** - Scale of your exported document.

4. **Image Resolution** - Set the image resolution to be used for your exported file.

5. _**Quality**_ - Set the quality of the exported file. This option is only available when you’re exporting your document as a JPEG file. Lowering the quality will decrease the file size.
