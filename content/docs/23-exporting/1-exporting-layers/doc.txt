# Exporting Layers

Alternatively, you can export your design layer by layer or object by object as an image or vector-based file. When ready to export, go to **File > Export Layers...** [**⌘** - **⇧** - **⌥** - **E**] to open the _**Export Layers**_ pop-up window.

1. **File Format** - Pick the file format to be used for the layer/object you are about to export.

2. **Export** - Set which layers to be exported. Select _**Layers**_ to export all layers or _**Tagged Layers and Objects**_ to export only the tagged layers and objects. To tag a layer, a group or an object go to the _**Layers panel**_ and simply add a file extension to the name of that layer, group or object.
