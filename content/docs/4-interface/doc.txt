The (link: docs/interface/toolbar text: _**Toolbar**_) provides access to the available drawing and editing tools while the (link: docs/interface/tool-options text: _**Tool Options bar**_) allows you to adjust the behavior of currently selected tool. The (link: docs/layers text: _**Layers panel**_) on the right side of the window can be used to work with the current documentâ€™s layers. Documents can be managed quickly and easily using the (link: docs/interface/document-tabs text: _**Document Tabs**_) at the top of the window.
