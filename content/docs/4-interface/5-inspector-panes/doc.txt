## Inspector panes

In addition to the main document window, Graphic also offers four floating inspector panels with additional features. Each panel has a distinct role, from changing various object settings to saving and reusing styles and object libraries.

The _**Properties**_ and _**Appearance**_ panels both have multiple panes of settings. You can switch between settings panes using the tab bar at the top of the panel.

Each floating inspector panel can be moved anywhere on the screen. A panel can be collapsed by clicking on its title bar, and snapped to the top or bottom of another inspector panel.
