## Canvas 

The Canvas is the visible area that defines a design. It is where illustrations are created; where objects are drawn and edited.

The grey area surrounding the canvas is non-printable ‘scratch’ space. Objects can overlap into this area, or they can be placed here while a design is being edited, however anything outside of the canvas will not be visible when printing or exporting the design.

#### Canvas Size

The size of the canvas can be changed at any time from the (link: docs/canvas/settings text: _**Canvas pane**_). The measurement units used for dimensions can be set to pixels, inches, millimeters, or centimeters.

#### Canvas Color

The background of the canvas can be set to be either a solid color, gradient, or image.
You can customize the background using the (link: docs/canvas/settings text: _**Canvas pane**_).

#### Rulers, Grid & Guides
