# Creating Brush Strokes

Choose the _**Brush tool**_ to create calligraphic brush strokes which appear as if they were drawn using a calligraphic pen or paintbrush. 

Activate the (link: docs/brushes/pressure-sensitive-brushes text: _**Use Pressure**_) feature to easily create pressure sensitive brushes.

The _**Brush tool**_ has a smoothing setting which can be used to control the amount of smoothing applied to newly drawn brush strokes. Adjust the brush _**width**_ and the amount of _**smoothing**_ using the _**Tool Options bar**_ settings.
