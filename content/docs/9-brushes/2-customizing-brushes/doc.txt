# Customizing Brushes

Clicking the brush preview button from the _**Tool Options bar**_ will open the _**Brush Settings pane**_. The drop-down menu next to the brush preview button gives you the possibility to enable or disable the _**Pressure Sensitive**_ feature.

1. **Brush Editor** -  you can use the Brush Editor to edit and customize brushes. Edit a brush manually by dragging the blue circular handles to change its angle and roundness, or edit the brush numerically by inputting values into the brush parameter fields.

2. **Roundness** -  this setting determines the roundness of the brush. Higher values create a rounder brush, while lower values create a flatter brush.

3. **Angle** - the brush angle refers to the angle of rotation of the brush. 0˚ will create a horizontal brush, 90˚ will create a vertical brush.

4. **Minimum Width** - the minimum width refers to the minimum width of the brush according to the brush width. A Minimum Width set to 50% will make sure that the brush size for your path will not go below 50% of the pre-set brush width. The brush width on an existing path can be easily edited using the _**Stroke pane**_ from the _**Appearance panel**_.

5. **Contour** - Using the white draggable handles that make up the orange path you can create complex brushes that simulate pressure sensitivity. 

 Simply double-click the orange path to add new draggable handles or double-click existing draggable handles to easily remove them.

 Placing a handle to the top of the frame brings the brush width to 100% while placing it at the bottom of the frame lowers the width to the Minimum Width percentage.

6. **Brush Preview** - a simple preview of your new brush based on the introduced properties.

7. **Reset** - Resets the brush properties from the Contour frame.

8. **Save Brush** - quickly save the existing brush in the top of the _**Saved Brushes pane**_.

For more elementary brushes you can use the _**Brush pane**_ from the _**Appearance panel**_. It comes with the same customization options from the _**Brush Settings pane**_, excluding the pressure sensitivity settings. 

You can create or choose the brush to use when drawing with the _**Brush tool**_, or you can apply a calligraphic brush to any object.
