# Pressure Sensitive Brushes

Pressure sensitivity determines the width variation of the brush that you are about to draw. It's done by applying  different pressure on the surface of a Graphics Tablet or the Force Touch Trackpad.

The drop-down menu next to the brush preview button gives you the possibility to enable or disable this feature. Select _**Use Pressure**_ to turn it on or _**Fixed Width**_ to turn it off.

You can adjust the contour of a path after it's drawn using the _**Brush Settings pane**_.
