# Creating Layers

To create a new layer, click the _**Add Layer**_ button (**+**), or choose _**New Layer**_ from the _**Layer actions menu**_. Alternatively, you can use the **Arrange > New Layer** [**⇧** - **⌘** - **N**] command from the menu bar. A new empty layer will be created above the currently selected layer. 

To change the name of a layer, simply double-click on the layer’s name field, to the right of its thumbnail.
