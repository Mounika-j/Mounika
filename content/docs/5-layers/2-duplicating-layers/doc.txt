# Duplicating Layers

At times it can be useful to create an exact duplicate of an existing layer, including copies of the objects within that layer. 

To duplicate a layer, choose _**Duplicate Layer**_ from the _**Layer actions menu**_, or **Arrange > Duplicate Layer** [**⇧** - **⌘** - **D**] from the menu bar.
