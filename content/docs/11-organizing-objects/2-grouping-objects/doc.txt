# Grouping Objects

Several objects can be combined into a group. Groups can be easily manipulated together as a single object. Grouping objects can be useful when you are looking to transform several objects without affecting their attributes or relative positions. 

Use the _**Group**_ commands from the _**Alignment pane**_ of the Properties panel to group or ungroup multiple objects. Using one of the two commands you can:

**Group** - Combines selected objects/groups into a group. 
Alternatively, you can choose **Arrange > Group** [**⌘** - **G**] from the menu bar or you can simply right click on the canvas and go to **Group**. 

**Ungroup** - Removes the group and keeps the separate objects. 
Alternatively, you can choose **Arrange > Ungroup** [**⇧** - **⌘** - **G**] from the menu bar or you can simply right click on the canvas and go to **Ungroup**. 

Getting used with the keyboard shortcuts will make things a lot easier and faster.

Newly made groups will show up as _'Group'_ in the _**Layers panel**_. Grouping objects from separate layers will create the group in the layer of the topmost selected object. 

Groups can also be grouped with other objects or groups.

To select a single object from a group, choose the _**Move tool**_ or the _**Path Selection tool**_ and double click on it.
