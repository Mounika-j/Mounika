# Expanding Text

Choose _**Modify > Convert Text to Outlines**_ with a text object selected to convert it to vector paths. This will allow you to edit each individual glyph, and edit the paths and points that make up the text.

Same result can be achieved using the _**Convert Text to Outlines**_ button located in the _**Text pane**_ from the Appearance panel.
