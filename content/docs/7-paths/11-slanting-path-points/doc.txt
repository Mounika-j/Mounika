# Slanting Path Points

Choose the _**Shear tool**_ to slant path points around a reference point.

To slant one or more path points, first select the path points using the _**Path Selection tool**_. With the _**Shear tool**_ active, click and drag anywhere on the canvas to slant the path points around the reference point.

Hold the **Shift â‡§** key while dragging to slant selected path points on only one axis (horizontally or vertically).

> Tip: Use the **Shift - S** keyboard shortcut to quickly select the Shear tool. 


Path points can be slanted numerically using the _**Tool Options bar**_ settings. Set the vertical and horizontal shear angles, and then click _**Shear**_ to apply the transformation.

By default, the reference point will be located in the center of the selected object. To use a different location for the reference point, simply drag it to set it at that new location.
