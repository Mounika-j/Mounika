# Adding Path Points

The _**Pen tool**_ can also be used to add points to any path. The settings in the _**Tool Options bar**_ can be used to change the Pen tool from the default path creation mode, to the _**Add Points**_ mode.

Remember to first select the path to edit using the Move or Path Selection tools. 
After choosing the _**Add Points**_ mode, simply click anywhere on the selected path to add a new anchor point.
