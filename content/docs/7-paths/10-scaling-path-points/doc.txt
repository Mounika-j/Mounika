# Scaling Path Points

Choose the _**Scale tool**_ to scale path points around a reference point.

To scale one or more path points, first select the path points using the _**Path Selection tool**_. With the _**Scale tool**_ active, click and drag anywhere on the canvas to scale the path points around the reference point.

Hold the **Shift â‡§** key while dragging to constrain the width, the height or both attributes while performing the scaling.

> Tip: Use the **S** keyboard shortcut to quickly select the **Scale tool**. 


Objects can be scaled numerically using the _**Tool Options bar**_ settings. Set the percent to scale vertically and horizontally, and then click _**Scale**_ to apply the scaling.

By default, the reference point will be located in the center of the selected object. To use a different location for the reference point, simply drag it to set it at that new location.
