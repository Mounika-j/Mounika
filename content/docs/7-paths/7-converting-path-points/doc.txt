# Converting Path Points

Choose the _**Convert Anchor tool**_ to convert path points to either smooth points (anchor points with direction handles) or corners (anchor points without direction handles).

To convert a corner point to a smooth point, simply click on the point with the _**Convert Anchor tool**_ and drag to create direction handles around the point.

You can also adjust the curvature of the path around a smooth point by dragging its direction handles separately.
