# Appending an Existing Path

The _**Pen tool**_ can append additional segments to an existing unclosed path. First select the path to edit using the Move or Path Selection tools, and then switch to the _**Pen tool**_. Click on one of the endpoints of the path to begin editing (or click and drag to create a direction handle).
