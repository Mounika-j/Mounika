The _**Pen tool**_ can also be used to remove points from any path. The settings in the _**Tool Options bar**_ can be used to change the Pen tool from the default path creation mode, to the _**Delete Points**_ mode.

Remember to first select the path to edit using the Move or Path Selection tools. 
After choosing the _**Delete Points**_ mode, simply click on any anchor point in the selected path to delete that point.
