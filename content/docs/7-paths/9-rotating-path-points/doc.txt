# Rotating Path Points

Choose the _**Rotate tool**_ to rotate path points around a reference point.

To rotate one or more path points, first select the path points using the _**Path Selection tool**_. With the _**Rotate tool**_ active, click and drag anywhere on the canvas to rotate the path points clockwise or counterclockwise.

Hold the **Shift ⇧** key while dragging to constrain the rotation to 15˚ increments.

> Tip: Use the **R** keyboard shortcut to quickly select the **Rotate tool**. 

Path points can be rotated numerically using the _**Tool Options bar**_ settings. Set a rotation angle in the field and click _**Rotate**_ to apply the rotation.

By default, the reference point will be located in the center of the selected object. To use a different location for the reference point, simply drag it to set it at that new location.
