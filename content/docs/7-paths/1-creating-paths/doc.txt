# Creating Paths

Objects in Graphic are composed of vector paths. Paths themselves are made up of anchor points connecting straight lines and curved segments. Anchor points are shown on a path as empty squares, while selected anchor points are shown as filled squares. 

Choose the  _**Pen tool**_ to draw any kind of path or shape, using a combination of straight lines and curves. Because of its versatility, it is the most important of Graphic’s drawing tools to learn and become proficient using. 

The _**Pen tool**_ can also be used to add or remove points from any path, or to cut paths. The settings in the _**Tool Options bar**_ can be used to change the Pen tool from the default path creation mode, to the (link: docs/paths/adding-path-points text: _**Add Points**_), (link: docs/paths/deleting-path-points text: _**Delete Points**_) or (link: docs/paths/cutting-paths text: _**Cut Paths**_) modes.

Use the default _**Pen tool**_ mode to create straight line segments, by simply clicking on the canvas. Hold the **Shift ⇧** key  to easily create horizontal or vertical paths.

> Tip: Use the **P** keyboard shortcut to quickly select the **Pen tool**. 


To finish editing a path, simply click on the first point in the path to close it. Alternatively, pressing the **Esc** key will end editing the current path without closing it. After closing the current path, the Pen tool can be used to create a new path.

To create curved segments, click and drag to create anchor points with direction handles. Holding the **Shift ⇧** key  will constrain the direction handles to 45˚ increments.

#### Creating a Line Segment after a Curve
A straight line segment can be drawn after a curve segment by removing the direction handle at the end of the path. Simply click on the last anchor point to remove the direction handle.

#### Creating a Curve after a Line Segment
A curved segment can be drawn after a line segment by creating a direction handle at the end of the path. Simply click on the end anchor point and drag to create a direction handle.
