# Freehand Paths

Choose the _**Pencil tool**_ to draw freeform paths. It can be a great tool for creating a quick sketch of a design, since it can create paths quickly without needing to draw a complex path segment by segment, as with the Pen tool. Simply click and drag to draw a new path.

The _**Pencil tool**_ has a smoothing setting which can be used to control the amount of smoothing applied to newly drawn paths. Adjust the line _**width**_ and the amount of _**smoothing**_ using the _**Tool Options bar**_ settings.
