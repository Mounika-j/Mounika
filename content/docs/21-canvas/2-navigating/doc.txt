# Navigating the Canvas

Use the scroll-wheel on your mouse or a trackpad to scroll in any direction. 

Holding down the _**Spacebar**_ key activates the _**Hand tool**_ which gives you the possibility to click and drag to move the visible area of the canvas. Simply release the _**Spacebar**_ key and you will return to the original tool. Alternatively, you can select the _**Hand tool**_ from your _**Toolbar**_.
