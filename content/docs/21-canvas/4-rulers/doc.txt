Rulers allow you to visualize the coordinates of selected objects and to accurately position them on the canvas. To show or hide rulers, go to **View > Show/Hide Rulers** [**âŒ˜** - **R**].

Rulers appear along the top and left side of your active document. The  0 point on each ruler is located at the top-left corner of your canvas. Markers on the rulers will highlight the position of any selected object.
