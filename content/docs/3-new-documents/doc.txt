1. **Canvas Style** - Choose from a variety of canvas styles – including graph paper, notebook paper, and blueprint – for the perfect canvas for a particular project.
All canvas styles are created using variations of the built-in grid and background color settings, making them fully customizable. Customize your document further using the (link: docs/canvas/settings text: _**Canvas pane**_) or the (link: docs/canvas/grid text: _**Grid pane**_).

2. **Presets** - Quickly choose the size for the new document from a list of preset sizes. Simply choose a preset from the list, such as **_Letter_** or **_A4_**, and the dimensions of that preset automatically fill the width and height fields.
