# Fills

The _**Fill**_ attribute is used to adjust an objectâ€™s content. Changes are applied to the currently selected objects. Colors, gradients, patterns or images can be added to fills. 

Click any _**Fill**_ to get access to its properties. As with the other attributes, multiple _**Fills**_ can be added to an object.

1. **Color Well** - Set the color and its transparency or pick a gradient/pattern from the Gradient/Pattern palette.

2. **Type** - Choose the fill type between: _**Color**_, _**Linear Gradient**_, _**Radial Gradient**_, _**Angle Gradient**_, _**Pattern**_ or _**Image**_.  Choosing a gradient, a pattern or an image  will give you access to the same editing settings from the _**Fill pane**_.

3. **Blend** - Pick a blend mode for your fill from the twenty three options.
