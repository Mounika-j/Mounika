# Drop Shadows

The _**Drop Shadow **_ effect is used to add a shadow effect and to adjust its color, offset and blur. Changes are applied to the currently selected objects. 

Click any effect to get access to its properties.  As with the other attributes, multiple _**Drop Shadow**_ effects can be added to an object.

1. **Color** - Set the color of the effect and its transparency.

2. **Blend** - Pick a blend mode for your drop shadow from the twenty three options.

3. **Preview** - A preview of your drop shadow based on the introduced properties.

4. **Offset** - The X and Y offset correspond to the distance from the object, X represents the horizontal axis while Y represents the vertical axis.

5. **Size** - Set the amount of blur that should be added for this effect. A higher blur value will result in a larger and blurrier shadow.

6. **Clip** - Check this box to clip the part of the shadow below your object. The result is noticeable when the _**Fill**_ is inactive.
