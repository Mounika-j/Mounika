The line endings for created lines can be customized using the (link: docs/effects/strokes#stroke-pane text: _**Stroke pane**_) or the (link: docs/effects/strokes text: _**Effects pane**_) from the _**Appearance panel**_. When creating lines with the _**Arrowed Line**_ mode, the previously selected line endings will be used.
