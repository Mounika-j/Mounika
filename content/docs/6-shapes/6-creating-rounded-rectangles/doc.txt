# Rounded Rectangles

Choose the _**Rounded Rectangle tool**_ to draw rectangles or squares with rounded corners. Simply click and drag inside your Canvas to create a new shape.

Vary the roundness of the corners using the _**Corner Radius**_ setting in the _**Tool Options bar**_. Use the rounded square icon next to the Corner Radius input box to disable or enable the roundness for a certain corner. 

As with the Rectangle tool, holding the **Shift â‡§** key while dragging will allow you to create squares with rounded corners.
