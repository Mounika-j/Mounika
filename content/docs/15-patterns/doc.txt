# Patterns

Patterns consist of a tile repeated horizontally, vertically or at an angle. Patterns can be used to stylize the _**Fill**_ of any object, even text. 

The _**Fill**_ color well in the _**Toolbar**_ can be used to select a pre-made gradient from the (link: docs/patterns/patterns-palette text: _**Pattern palette**_). Drawing tools will use these colors when creating new objects.

Patterns can be customized using the (link: docs/patterns/customizing-patterns text: _**Fill pane**_) or the (link: docs/effects/fills text: _**Effects pane**_) from the Appearance panel. Additionally, you can adjust the position and scale of your pattern using the (link: docs/patterns/pattern-tool text: _**Pattern tool**_).
