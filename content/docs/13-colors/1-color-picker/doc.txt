# Color Picker

Click the _**Fill**_ color well from your _**Toolbar**_ to open the _**Color panel**_. Use the _**Color Picker**_ to select a custom color. To show the _**Color Picker**_ open the drop-down menu below the color thumbnail and select _**Color Picker**_.

Alternatively, you can press the **X** key to open the _**Color panel**_ for the _**Stroke**_. Pressing the **X** key again will open the _**Color panel**_ for the _**Fill**_.

1. **Tab Menu** - Easily navigate between the **Color**, **Gradient** and **Patterns** palettes. 
It only shows up when you click the **Fill** color well, as gradients or patterns can't be applied on a **Stroke**.

2. **Eyedropper Tool** - Can be used to select a color by picking the color of any pixel on the screen. To activate the _**Eyedropper tool**_, click on its icon in the _**Color panel**_. The cursor will become an Eyedropper that shows a magnified area of the pixels underneath it. Clicking on any pixel on the screen will choose that color.

3. **Color** - A simple thumbnail showing the current color. 

4. ** Default Colors** - A quick way to choose between black, white or _'**none**'_. 

5. ** Color Panels** - Switch between _**Color Picker**_, _**Color Palette**_ or one of the four _**Color Slider**_ panes. 

6. **Color Bar** - Drag the slider or simply click on the _**Color Bar**_ to select a hue. 

7. **Color Field** - Click and drag the circle inside the _**Color Field**_ to select the shade of the color. 

8. **RGB** - Use the **Red**, **Green** and **Blue** fields to input a specific RGB color code. 

9. **HEX** - Use this field to input a specific HEX color code or to copy the current one.  

10. **Alpha** - Drag the slider or use the input field to set the transparency of the color. Setting Alpha to 0% will make the color invisible.

### Color Sliders

In addition to the _**Color Picker**_, you can use one of the four _**Color Slider**_ panels to select a custom color. You can choose between _**Grayscale**_, _**RGB**_, _**CMYK**_ or _**HSB**_. Each slider panel gives you the possibility to choose a new color using their specific color codes.
