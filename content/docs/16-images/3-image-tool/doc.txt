# Image Tool

Use the _**Image tool**_ to scale and position an image fill inside of a shape’s bounds, cropping the image non-destructively.

Choose the _**Move tool**_ and double click on an object with an image fill to activate the _**Image Tool**_. The _**Image Tool**_ will display as the selected tool in the _**Tool Options bar**_. 

The image can be scaled using the _**Image Scale**_ slider or by dragging the bottom-right corner of the applied image. Simply drag your image to change its position within the shape’s bounds.

To reset the image’s size and position to the defaults, click _**Reset**_ in the _**Tool Options bar**_. 

When finished, click anywhere on the canvas to end editing and revert to the Move tool.
