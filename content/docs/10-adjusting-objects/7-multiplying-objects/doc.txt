# Multiplying Objects

You can quickly duplicate objects or groups using the classic **Copy** and **Paste** commands. 

Choose **Edit > Copy** [**⌘** - **C**] from the menu bar to easily copy a selected object/group or **Edit > Cut** [**⌘** - **X**] to cut it.

Choose **Edit > Paste** [**⌘** - **V**] from the menu bar to add the copy of your object/group in the center of the  workspace view or **Edit > Paste in Place** [**⇧** - **⌘** - **X**] to paste the object/group in its exact previous position. 

You can also use the _**Move Tool**_ to duplicate an object or a group. Hold down the **Option ⌥** key and simply drag your selected object to duplicate it.

### Smart Duplicate

Choose **Edit > Duplicate** [**⌘** - **D**] from the menu bar to easily duplicate a selected object/group. Alternatively, you can use this command to instantly apply multiple move, rotate, scale, and shear transformations to each duplicated object. 

Select an object/group, hold down the **Option ⌥** key and simply drag your selection to duplicate it. Keep this new shape selected and simply hit the **⌘** - **D** keyboard shortcut to quickly repeat the duplicate and move commands you just performed.

Select an object/group, hold down the **Option ⌥** key and simply drag your selection to duplicate it. Keep this copy selected and place it above the original object/group, and then pick the _**Rotate Tool**_ and place the reference point wherever you wish. Rotate your selection manually and then hit the **⌘** - **D** keyboard shortcut to quickly add new copies around that reference point using the same angle of rotation.

Don't forget that the rule is to first duplicate the object by dragging while holding down the **Option ⌥** key, and you shouldn't deselect the object between operations. You can scale, rotate and slant your copy, and then hit **⌘** - **D** to repeat all commands from duplicating to slanting included.
