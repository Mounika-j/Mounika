# Moving Objects

Choose the _**Move tool**_ to select and move objects or groups. Objects can be moved by clicking on them and dragging to a new position. 

To constrain movement to a single direction, hold down the **Shift ⇧** key while dragging.

Objects can be moved numerically using the settings in the _**Tool Options bar**_ or the _**Position**_ settings from the _**Geometry pane**_ of the Properties panel.

If the object has no fill or if (link: docs/canvas/view-modes#outline-mode text: _**Outline mode**_) is enabled, moving it is done by dragging its contour.

#### Nudging Objects

Selected objects can be nudged slightly in any direction by using the arrows keys. 

Push the right arrow button to move your selection _1 px_ to the right. Holding the **Shift ⇧** key will move your selection _10 px_ to the right.
