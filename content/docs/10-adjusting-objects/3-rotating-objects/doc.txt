#Rotating Objects

Choose the _**Rotate tool**_ to rotate objects around a reference point.

To rotate one or more objects, first select the objects to be rotated and choose the _**Rotate tool**_. With the Rotate tool active, click and drag anywhere on the canvas to rotate the objects clockwise or counterclockwise.

To constrain the rotation to 15˚ increments, hold the **Shift ⇧** key while dragging.

> Tip: Use the **R** keyboard shortcut to quickly select the **Rotate tool**. 


Objects can be rotated numerically using the _**Tool Options bar**_. Set a rotation angle in the field and click _**Rotate**_ to apply the rotation. Clicking _**Copy**_ will duplicate the objects first and then apply the rotation to the copied objects.

Alternatively, objects can be rotated numerically using the _**Rotation**_ settings from the _**Geometry pane**_ of the Properties panel.

By default, the reference point will be located in the center of the selected objects. To use a different location for the reference point, click-and-drag it to set it at that new location.

Objects can also be rotated manually using Move tool's bounding box. 

Choose the _**Move tool**_ and make a selection. Moving the mouse pointer slightly outside of a bounding box handle will change the cursor to a curve with arrows at each end.  Clicking and dragging in this mode will rotate the selected objects.

Holding down the **Shift ⇧** key while rotating will constrain the rotation to 15˚ increments.

Finally, you can choose **Modify > Rotate and Transform > Rotate 90˚Clockwise** from the menu bar to rotate the selection 90˚clockwise or **Modify > Rotate and Transform > Rotate 90˚Counter-Clockwise** to rotate the selection 90˚counter-clockwise.
